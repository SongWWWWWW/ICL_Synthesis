        "question": "A bakery sells a total of 480 loaves of bread per day. They sell a combination of whole wheat and white bread. If they sell 3/4 of their bread as whole wheat and 1/4 as white bread, how many loaves of whole wheat bread are sold per day?",
        "answer": "To find the number of loaves of whole wheat bread sold per day, we need to multiply the total number of loaves sold per day by the fraction that represents the whole wheat bread. The total number of loaves sold per day is 480, and 3/4 of the bread is whole wheat. To multiply a number by a fraction, we can multiply the number by the numerator and then divide by the denominator. So, we multiply 480 by 3 and then divide by 4. 480 x 3 = 1440, and 1440/4 = 360. Therefore, 360 loaves of whole wheat bread are sold per day. ###{360}"

        "question": "A car travels from City A to City B at an average speed of 60 miles per hour and returns from City B to City A at an average speed of 40 miles per hour. What is the average speed for the entire trip?",
        "answer": "To find the average speed for the entire trip, we need to find the total distance traveled and the total time taken. Since the car travels from City A to City B and back, the total distance is twice the distance from City A to City B. Let's call the distance from City A to City B \"d\". The time taken to travel from City A to City B is d/60, and the time taken to travel from City B to City A is d/40. The total time is d/60 + d/40. To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 120. So, the total time is 2d/120 + 3d/120 = 5d/120. The average speed is the total distance divided by the total time. The total distance is 2d, and the total time is 5d/120. To divide by a fraction, we can multiply by its reciprocal. So, the average speed is (2d) x (120/5d) = 240/5 = 48 miles per hour. ###{48}"

        "answer": "The average speed of the car for the entire trip can be calculated using the formula: Average speed = (2 * distance) / (time taken to travel from A to B + time taken to travel from B to A). Since the distance between City A and City B is the same for both trips, let\\'s call it d. The time taken to travel from A to B is d/60 and the time taken to travel from B to A is d/40. The total distance traveled is 2d. The total time taken is d/60 + d/40. We can simplify this to (8d + 6d) / 240 = 14d / 240. The average speed is then (2 * 2d) / (14d / 240) = 480 / 14 = 34.29 km/h. ###{34}"

Since the total number of students is 20, we can set up the equation: x + 3x + 5x = 20. To solve for x, we need to combine like terms: 9x = 20. Divide both sides by 9: x = 20/9. The number of students in the third group is 5x = 5 * (20/9) = 100/9. Therefore, there are 100/9 students in the third group, which is approximately 11.11 students. ###{11}"

If 120 books are added to the bookshelf, the number of books on the bookshelf is 120 + 40 = 160. Since the bookshelf can hold 40 books, the number of books that can still be added is 40 - 120 = -80, but since you cannot have a negative number of books, this is a trick question. The real answer is that the bookshelf can hold 40 more books, but it will be full, and no more books can be added.

We can solve this system of equations by substitution or elimination. Using substitution, we can express x as x = 120 - y and substitute it into the second equation: 15(120 - y) + 8y = 1240. Simplifying the equation, we get 1800 - 15y + 8y = 1240, which reduces to -7y = -560. Solving for y, we get y = 80. Then, substituting y = 80 into the equation x = 120 - y, we get x = 120 - 80 = 40. Therefore, the number of large pizzas sold is ###{40}."

We can solve this system of equations by substitution or elimination. Using substitution, we can express x as x = 480 - y and substitute it into the second equation: 2(480 - y) + 1.5y = 840. Simplifying the equation, we get 960 - 2y + 1.5y = 840, which reduces to -0.5y = -120. Solving for y, we get y = 240. Therefore, the number of loaves of white bread sold is ###{240}."

If they sell 15 more whole wheat loaves than white bread loaves, and they sell 1/4 of the total loaves as whole wheat, how many loaves of whole wheat bread do they sell?",
        "answer": "Let's denote the number of white bread loaves as x. Since they sell 15 more whole wheat loaves than white bread, the number of whole wheat loaves is x + 15. We know that 1/4 of the total loaves are whole wheat, so the equation becomes: x + 15 = 1/4 * 250. To solve for x, we first multiply both sides by 4 to get 4x + 60 = 250. Then we subtract 60 from both sides to get 4x = 190. Finally, we divide both sides by 4 to get x = 47.5. Since they sell 15 more whole wheat loaves than white bread, the number of whole wheat loaves is x + 15 = 47.5 + 15 = 62.5. Since we can't sell a fraction of a loaf, we round down to the nearest whole number, so they sell 62 loaves of whole wheat bread. ###{62}"

        "answer": "Let\\'s say the number of vanilla cupcakes is x. Since they sold 40 more chocolate cupcakes than vanilla cupcakes, the number of chocolate cupcakes is x + 40. We know that the total number of cupcakes is 180, so we can set up the equation x + (x + 40) = 180. Combining like terms, we get 2x + 40 = 180. Subtracting 40 from both sides, we get 2x = 140. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 70. So, they sold 70 vanilla cupcakes. Answer is ###{70}."

Since there are 90 books, we need to find out how many more shelves are needed to hold 90 - 27 = 63 more books.

        "answer": "Since the bookshelf is empty initially, we start with 0 books. 3/5 of 0 is 0, so 3/5 of the books are added, which is 0. Now we need to add the 2/5 of the books that are not added, which is 0. So the total number of books on the bookshelf is 0 + 0 = 0. However, this problem does not make sense, so let's rephrase it to a different problem: A bookshelf has 5 shelves, and each shelf can hold 8 books. If 3/5 of the bookshelf is filled, how many books are on the bookshelf now? Since 3/5 of the bookshelf is filled, 2/5 is not filled. Each shelf can hold 8 books, so 5 shelves can hold 5 x 8 = 40 books. 2/5 of 40 is 16, so 2/5 of the bookshelf is not filled. Since 3/5 of the bookshelf is filled, the number of books on the bookshelf is 40 - 16 = 24. Answer is ###{24}."

The total number of boxes is the sum of small and large boxes, which is 3x + x = 4x. We know the total number of boxes is 480, so 4x = 480. To find x, we divide both sides by 4, which gives x = 480 / 4 = 120. Since the number of small boxes is 3x, the number of small boxes sold is 3 x 120 = 360. So, the bakery sold 360 small boxes.

To find the number of loaves of white bread, we need to multiply the total number of loaves by 2/3. 2/3 * 480 = 320. However, we know that the bakery sells 60 more loaves of whole wheat than white bread. Let's say the number of white bread loaves is x. Then, the number of whole wheat loaves is x + 60. We know that x + (x + 60) = 320. Simplifying, we get 2x + 60 = 320. Subtracting 60 from both sides, we get 2x = 260. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 130.

        "answer": "To find the average speed of the entire trip, we need to find the total distance traveled and the total time taken. Since the distance from city A to city B is the same as the distance from city B to city A, we can call it x. The time taken to travel from A to B is x/80 and the time taken to travel from B to A is x/60. The total time is (x/80 + x/60). The total distance is 2x. The total time is (5x/480 + 8x/480) = (13x/480). The average speed is 2x / (13x/480) = 2x * (480/13x) = 960/13 = 73.85 km/h. The average speed of the entire trip is ###{73.85} km/h."

The time taken to travel from City A to City B is d/60 and the time taken to travel back is d/40. The total time is d/60 + d/40. The total distance is 2d. The average speed is total distance / total time = 2d / (d/60 + d/40). To simplify this, we can find the least common multiple of 60 and 40, which is 120. So, we can rewrite the equation as 2d / ((d/120) + (3d/120)). This simplifies to 2d / (4d/120) = 2d * 120 / 4d = 60. The average speed for the round trip is ###{60}."

If a small box contains 12 cookies and a large box contains 18 cookies, how many cookies were sold in total?",
        "answer": "Let's assume the number of large boxes is x. Then, the number of small boxes is x + 120. We know that the total number of boxes is 480, so x + (x + 120) = 480. Combining like terms, we get 2x + 120 = 480. Subtracting 120 from both sides, we get 2x = 360. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 180. This means there are 180 large boxes and 180 + 120 = 300 small boxes. The total number of cookies from large boxes is 180 x 18 = 3240 and from small boxes is 300 x 12 = 3600.

The equation becomes (2x) / ((2x / 120) + (3x / 120)). Simplifying further, we get (2x) / (5x / 120). Cancelling out the x's, we get 240 / 5 = 48. Therefore, the average speed for the entire round trip is 48 miles per hour. ###{48}"

        "answer": "To find the average speed of the entire trip, we need to find the total distance traveled and the total time taken. Let's say the distance between City A and City B is d. The time taken to travel from City A to City B is d/60, and the time taken to travel from City B to City A is d/40. The total time taken is d/60 + d/40. To find the total distance, we can use the fact that the distance from City A to City B is the same as the distance from City B to City A, which is d. The average speed is given by total distance / total time. We can simplify the total time expression as (8d + 6d) / 240 = 14d / 240 = d / 20. The average speed is d / (d / 20) = 20.

        "answer": "To find the average speed for the round trip, we need to find the total distance traveled and the total time taken. Since the distance is the same for both trips, let\\'s call it x. The time taken to travel from City A to City B is x / 60 and the time taken to return is x / 40. The total time is x / 60 + x / 40. To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 120. So, we get (2x + 3x) / 120 = 5x / 120. The total distance is 2x, so the average speed is 2x / (5x / 120) = 2 * 120 / 5 = 48 km/h.

The time taken to travel from A to B is d/60 and the time taken to travel from B to A is d/40. The total time is (d/60) + (d/40). To find the total distance, we can use the formula distance = speed x time. So, d = 60 x (d/60) and d = 40 x (d/40). We can simplify this to d = d. The total distance is 2d. The total time is (d/60) + (d/40). To find the common denominator, we can multiply the first fraction by 40/40 and the second fraction by 60/60. This gives us (8d/240) + (6d/240). Combining like terms, we get (14d/240). To simplify, we can divide the numerator and denominator by 2, which gives us (7d/120). The total distance is 2d. We can find the average speed by dividing the total distance by the total time. So, average speed = 2d / (7d/120) = 2d * (120/7d) = 240/7. The answer is ###{34}."

        "answer": "The average speed for a round trip is the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken. Since the distance to and from City A and City B is the same, we can assume it is x. The time taken to travel from City A to City B is x / 60, and the time taken to travel back is x / 40. The total time taken is x / 60 + x / 40. To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 120. So, the total time taken is (2x + 3x) / 120 = 5x / 120. The average speed is the total distance divided by the total time: x / (5x / 120) = 120 / 5 = 24 miles per hour. Answer is ###{24}."

        "answer": "First, we need to find out how many books the bookshelf can hold in total. Since there are 5 shelves and each shelf can hold 8 books, we multiply 5 x 8 = 40. This means the bookshelf can hold 40 books in total. Since 48 books are already added, we subtract 48 from 40 to find out how many more books can be added. 40 - 48 is not possible, so we need to find the difference, which is actually -8. However, we can't have a negative number of books, so the bookshelf is actually full. To find out how many more books can be added, we should subtract 48 from the total capacity. 40 - 48 is -8. However, to get the correct answer, we need to think about the problem in a different way. The question asks how many more books can be added, not how many books are left. Since the bookshelf is full, we can't add any more books. So, the answer is 0 books can be added to the bookshelf. The answer is ###{0}."

Since the distance from City A to City B is the same as the distance from City B to City A, we can denote the distance as D. The time taken to travel from City A to City B is D/60 and the time taken to travel from City B to City A is D/40. Therefore, the total time taken is D/60 + D/40. To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator, which is 120. So, the total time taken is (2D + 3D)/120 = 5D/120 = D/24. The average speed is the total distance divided by the total time, which is D / (D/24) = 24 km/h. ###{24}."

        "answer": "To find the average speed of the car for the entire trip, we need to find the total distance traveled and divide it by the total time taken. Since the distance between city A and city B is the same in both directions, we can assume it to be x. The time taken to travel from A to B is x / 60 and the time taken to travel from B to A is x / 40. The total time taken is x / 60 + x / 40. To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 120. So, the total time taken is (2x + 3x) / 120 = 5x / 120 = x / 24. The total distance traveled is 2x. So, the average speed is 2x / (x / 24) = 48 km/h. The average speed of the car for the entire trip is 48 km/h. ###{48}."

If the ratio of whole wheat to white bread is 2:8, how many loaves of whole wheat bread do they sell per day?', 'answer': \"Let's represent the number of whole wheat bread as 2x and white bread as 8x. Since the total number of bread is 480, we can write the equation 2x + 8x = 480. Solving for x, we get 10x = 480, so x = 480 / 10 = <<480/10=48>>48. Therefore, the number of whole wheat bread sold is 2x = 2 * 48 = <<2*48=96>>96 loaves. The bakery sells ###{96} loaves of whole wheat bread per day.\"}, {'question': 'A water tank can hold 300 gallons of water.

        "answer": "To find the average speed for the entire round trip, we need to find the total distance traveled and the total time taken. The average speed for each leg of the trip is given, so we can use the formula distance = speed x time. For the trip from City A to City B, the distance is 60 miles per hour x time. We can call this distance d1. For the return trip, the distance is 40 miles per hour x time, which we can call d2. Since the distance from City A to City B is the same as the distance from City B to City A, we can set d1 = d2. So, 60t = 40t, where t is the time for each leg of the trip. Solving for t, we get t = 60t / 40, which simplifies to t = 1.5. Now that we have the time for each leg of the trip, we can find the total time: 1.5 + 1.5 = 3 hours. The total distance traveled is 2d1, which is 2(60t) = 2(60 * 1.5) = 180 miles. To find the average speed for the entire round trip, we divide the total distance by the total time: 180 / 3 = 60.

Since the distance to and from City A and City B is the same, we can call it x. The time taken to travel from City A to City B is x / 60 hours and the time taken to travel back is x / 40 hours. The total time taken is (x / 60) + (x / 40). The total distance is 2x. The average speed is total distance / total time. So, the average speed is 2x / ((x / 60) + (x / 40)). We can simplify this by finding the common denominator: 2x / ((4x + 3x) / 120) = 2x / (7x / 120) = (2x * 120) / 7x = 240 / 7 = ###{34} miles per hour."

We can multiply the ratio by the same number to make the total parts equal to the total number of dollars. Let\\'s multiply the ratio by 12 to get 24:36:60. This means the total parts is 24+36+60 = 120. We can divide the total dollars by the total parts to get the value of one part: 120 / 120 = 1 dollar per part. Now we can find the amount each person gets by multiplying the number of parts each person gets by the value of one part. The first person gets 24 parts, so they get 24 * 1 = $<<24*1=24>>24. The second person gets 36 parts, so they get 36 * 1 = $<<36*1=36>>36. The third person gets 60 parts, so they get 60 * 1 = $<<60*1=60>>60."

        "question": "A car travels from city A to city B at an average speed of 60 km/h and returns from city B to city A at an average speed of 40 km/h. What is the average speed of the car for the entire trip?",
        "answer": "The average speed of the car for the entire trip can be found by taking the total distance traveled and dividing it by the total time taken. Since the distance from city A to city B is the same as the distance from city B to city A, we can let the distance be x. The time taken to travel from city A to city B is x/60 and the time taken to travel from city B to city A is x/40. The total time taken is x/60 + x/40. The average speed is x / (x/60 + x/40). To simplify this, we can find a common denominator: x / (x(40 + 60) / (60 * 40)). This simplifies to x / (x(100) / (2400)). The  x's cancel out, leaving 2400 / 100 = 24. So the average speed is 24 km/h. Answer is ###{24}."

        "answer": "To find the average speed for the entire round trip, we need to find the total distance traveled and the total time taken. Since the distance from city A to city B is the same as the distance from city B to city A, let\\'s call it x. The time taken to travel from city A to city B is x / 60, and the time taken to travel from city B to city A is x / 40. The total time taken is x / 60 + x / 40. To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 120. So, we can rewrite the fractions as (2x / 120) + (3x / 120) = 5x / 120. The total distance traveled is 2x, since we are traveling from city A to city B and back. To find the average speed, we can divide the total distance by the total time: 2x / (5x / 120) = 2x * (120 / 5x) = 240 / 5 = 48. So, the average speed of the car for the entire round trip is 48 km/h.

        "answer": "To find the number of large and small pizzas needed, we need to divide the total number of people by the number of people each pizza serves. We want to use as few pizzas as possible, so we should start with the largest pizzas first. 28 / 8 = 3.5, which means we need at least 4 large pizzas (since we can't have a fraction of a pizza). This will serve 4 x 8 = 32 people. We still need to serve 28 - 32 = -4 people, but since we can't have a negative number of people, we need to add more small pizzas. 28 - 32 = -4, so we need 4 less people to be served, and since we can't serve a negative number of people, we need to remove 4 people from the total, but since we can't remove people, we need to add 4 small pizzas to serve the remaining people. However, we can't serve a negative number of people, so we need to recalculate the number of large pizzas needed. 28 / 8 = 3.5, which means we need at least 4 large pizzas, but this will serve 32 people. We still need to serve 28 - 32 = -4 people, but since we can't have a negative number of people, we need to add more small pizzas. Since 4 large pizzas serve 32 people, and we only need to serve 28 people, we can actually use 3 large pizzas, which serve 24 people, and 4 people are left. We can serve the remaining 4 people with 1 small pizza. So, the pizza parlor should order 3 large pizzas and 1 small pizza. Answer is ###{3}."

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 120. So, the total time is (2d + 3d)/120 = 5d/120. The average speed is the total distance divided by the total time.

        "answer": "First, we need to find out how many loaves of bread are sold with a discount. Since they have a 20% discount for bulk orders of 30 loaves or more, we can divide the total number of loaves by 30 to get the number of bulk orders. 720 / 30 = 24. So, 24 bulk orders are sold with a discount. The remaining loaves are sold without a discount. 720 - (24 x 30) = 0 loaves are sold without a discount. Now, let\\'s calculate the revenue from the bulk orders. 24 x 30 = 720 loaves are sold with a discount. Since they are sold at 20% discount, the price of each loaf is $1.5 x 0.8 = $1.2.

        "answer": "To find the average speed of the round trip, we need to find the total distance traveled and divide it by the total time taken. Since the distance from City A to City B is the same as from City B to City A, let's call it d. The time taken to travel from City A to City B is d / 60 and the time taken to travel from City B to City A is d / 40. The total time taken is d / 60 + d / 40. To find the total distance, we can use the fact that distance = speed * time. So, the total distance is d + d = 2d. The average speed is the total distance divided by the total time, which is 2d / (d / 60 + d / 40). To simplify, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by 120 to get 240d / (20d + 30d) = 240d / 50d = 240 / 50 = 4.8. ###{4.8}"

        "answer": "To find the time it takes to fill the tank, we need to find the net flow rate of water into the tank. The net flow rate is the rate at which water is flowing in minus the rate at which water is flowing out. So, the net flow rate is 10 - 5 = 5 gallons per minute. To find the time it takes to fill the tank, we divide the total capacity of the tank by the net flow rate. So, it will take 1200 / 5 = 240 minutes to fill the tank. ###{240}"

Chocolate chip cookies are sold in boxes of 24, and oatmeal raisin cookies are sold in boxes of 30. How many boxes of each type of cookie are sold?', 'answer': \"Let's denote the number of boxes of chocolate chip cookies as x and the number of boxes of oatmeal raisin cookies as y. We can set up an equation: x + y = 480. Since chocolate chip cookies are sold in boxes of 24, the total number of chocolate chip cookies sold is 24x. Similarly, the total number of oatmeal raisin cookies sold is 30y. To find the number of boxes of each type of cookie, we can use the fact that the total number of cookies is a multiple of both 24 and 30. The least common multiple of 24 and 30 is 120. Therefore, we can write 480 = 2 * 240 = 4 * 120. This means that 240 boxes of cookies are sold in boxes of 24, and 240 boxes are sold in boxes of 30. So, x = 240 / 24 = 10, and y = 240 / 30 = 8.

The total time taken is d / 60 + d / 40 = (2d + 3d) / 120 = 5d / 120 = d / 24 hours. The total distance traveled is 2d. To find the average speed, we need to divide the total distance by the total time: (2d) / (d / 24) = 48 miles per hour. The average speed of the car for the round trip is 48 miles per hour. ###{48}"

        "answer": "The average speed of the car for the entire trip is the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken. Since the car travels at an average speed of 60 miles per hour from city A to city B and 40 miles per hour from city B to city A, we can assume the distance between the two cities is x. The time taken to travel from city A to city B is x / 60 and the time taken to travel from city B to city A is x / 40. The total time taken is x / 60 + x / 40. The average speed is the total distance divided by the total time, which is x / ((x / 60) + (x / 40)). To simplify this, we can find the least common multiple of 60 and 40, which is 120. So, we can rewrite the equation as x / ((2x / 120) + (3x / 120)). This simplifies to x / (5x / 120), which is 120 / 5 = 24 miles per hour. The answer is ###{24}."

Let the number of fiction books be 3x and the number of non-fiction books be 5x. The total number of books is 3x + 5x = 8x. We know the total number of books is 480, so we can set up the equation 8x = 480. To solve for x, we divide both sides by 8: x = 480 / 8 = 60. Now that we know x, we can find the number of non-fiction books: 5x = 5 * 60 = 300. Therefore, the bookstore sells 300 books of non-fiction per day.

        "question": "A bakery sells a total of 480 muffins and cakes in a day. The number of muffins sold is 3/5 of the total number of muffins and cakes sold. If a muffin costs $1.50 and a cake costs $2.50, how much money does the bakery make in total?",
        "answer": "To find the total amount of money made, we need to find the number of muffins and cakes sold first. Let's denote the number of muffins as M and the number of cakes as C. We know that M + C = 480. We also know that M = (3/5) * (M + C). Substituting M + C = 480, we get M = (3/5) * 480 = 288. So, the number of muffins sold is 288. The number of cakes sold is 480 - 288 = 192. The total amount of money made from muffins is 288 * $1.50 = $432. The total amount of money made from cakes is 192 * $2.50 = $480.

        "question": "A bakery sells a total of 480 muffins and cakes in a day. The number of cakes sold is 1/4 of the total number of muffins sold. How many muffins were sold?",
        "answer": "Since the number of cakes sold is 1/4 of the total number of muffins sold, the number of muffins sold is 4 times the number of cakes sold. Since the number of cakes sold is 1/4 of the total number of muffins sold, the number of cakes sold is 1/5 of the total number of baked goods. We can find the number of cakes by multiplying 1/5 by the total number of baked goods. 1/5 * 480 = (1 * 480) / 5 = 96 cakes.\\nSince the number of cakes sold is 1/4 of the total number of muffins sold, the number of muffins sold is 4 times the number of cakes sold. The number of muffins sold is 96 * 4 = 384. Answer is ###{384}."

        "question": "A bakery sells a total of 480 muffins and cakes in a day. The number of cakes sold is 2/3 of the number of muffins sold. How many muffins were sold?",
        "answer": "Since the number of cakes sold is 2/3 of the number of muffins sold, we can find the number of muffins by multiplying 1/3 by the total number of baked goods. However, we are given that the number of cakes sold is 2/3 of the number of muffins sold. So let the number of muffins sold be x. Then, the number of cakes sold is 2/3 * x. Since the total number of baked goods is 480, the number of muffins and cakes sold is x + 2/3 * x = 480. To find x, we can multiply both sides by 3. (x + 2/3 * x) * 3 = 480 * 3 = 3x + 2x = 5x = 1440. To find x, we can divide both sides by 5. x = 1440 / 5 = 288. Answer is ###{288}."

        "answer": "To find the average speed for the round trip, we need to find the total distance traveled and the total time taken. Since the distance is the same for both trips, we can use the formula: average speed = total distance / total time. We can simplify this as: average speed = 2 * distance / (time1 + time2). The time taken for each trip is distance / speed. So, the total time is (distance / 60) + (distance / 40). To find the average speed, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions in the total time expression, which is 120. Therefore, the average speed = 2 * distance / ((distance / 60) * (120 / 60) + (distance / 40) * (120 / 40)) = 2 * distance / ((2 * distance) / 120 + (3 * distance) / 120) = 2 * distance / ((5 * distance) / 120) = (2 * 120) / 5 = 48.

        "question": "A car travels from city A to city B at an average speed of 60 km/h and returns at an average speed of 40 km/h. What is the average speed for the round trip?",
        "answer": "To find the average speed for the round trip, we need to find the total distance traveled and the total time taken. Since the distance is the same for the round trip, we can assume it to be x. The time taken to travel from A to B is x/60 and the time taken to travel from B to A is x/40. The total time taken is x/60 + x/40. To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 120. So, the total time is (2x + 3x)/120 = 5x/120 = x/24. The average speed is the total distance divided by the total time, which is x / (x/24) = 24."

        "question": "A bakery sells 480 loaves of bread in a day. If they make a 10% discount for every 12 loaves of bread, how much money will they make in a day if each loaf costs $2.50?",
        "answer": "To find the total revenue, we first need to find the number of sets of 12 loaves of bread sold. 480 / 12 = 40 sets of 12 loaves. Since each set gets a 10% discount, we need to find 10% of 40 sets. 10% of 40 is 4 sets. Since each set of 12 loaves costs $2.50 * 12 = $30, we need to find 4 sets * $30. 4 * $30 = $120. Now, we need to find the number of sets that get the full price. 40 - 4 = 36 sets get the full price. Each set of 12 loaves costs $30, so 36 sets * $30 = $1080. The total revenue is $1080 + $120 = $1200. Answer is ###{1200}."

        "answer": "To find the average speed for the entire trip, we need to find the total distance traveled and the total time taken. Let's assume the distance between City A and City B is x km. The time taken to travel from City A to City B is x / 60 hours, and the time taken to return is x / 40 hours. The total time is (x / 60) + (x / 40) hours. To find the average speed, we need to divide the total distance by the total time. The total distance is 2x, and the total time is (x / 60) + (x / 40). To add the fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 120. (x / 60) + (x / 40) = (2x + 3x) / 120 = 5x / 120 = x / 24. The total distance is 2x, and the total time is x / 24.

If they sell 30% more whole wheat bread than white bread, how many loaves of whole wheat bread do they sell per day?', 'answer': \"Let's say the number of white bread loaves sold is x. Then, the number of whole wheat bread loaves sold is 1.3x (since it's 30% more). The total number of loaves sold is 1.3x + x = 2.3x. We know this is equal to 480. So, 2.3x = 480. To find x, we divide both sides by 2.3: x = 480 / 2.3 = 208.7. Since we can't sell a fraction of a loaf, we round down to 208. The number of whole wheat bread loaves sold is 1.3x = 1.3 * 208 = 270.8.

        "answer": "Let's denote the number of white bread loaves as W. Since they sell 60 more whole wheat loaves than white bread loaves, the number of whole wheat loaves is W + 60. The total number of loaves is W + (W + 60). We know that 3/5 of the total is whole wheat, so we can set up the equation: 3/5(W + W + 60) = 480. To solve for W, we first simplify the equation: 3/5(2W + 60) = 480. Multiply both sides by 5 to get: 3(2W + 60) = 2400. Distribute the 3: 6W + 180 = 2400. Subtract 180 from both sides: 6W = 2220.

        "answer": "To find the total profit, we need to first calculate the total revenue from selling whole wheat and rye bread. Let\\'s say x is the number of whole wheat bread sold. The number of rye bread sold is 480 - x. The revenue from whole wheat bread is 2.50x and the revenue from rye bread is 1.75(480 - x). The total revenue is 2.50x + 1.75(480 - x). The profit from each bread is 0.75, so the total profit is 0.75(2.50x + 1.75(480 - x)). We can simplify this to 1.875x + 0.75(480 - x) = 1.875x + 360 - 0.75x = 1.125x + 360. Since the total number of bread sold is 480, we have 2.50x + 1.75(480 - x) = 2.50x + 840 - 1.75x = 0.75x + 840. This simplifies to 0.75x + 840 = 0.75(480) + 840 = 360 + 840 = 1200.

        "answer": "Let's say the amount of money each person receives is represented by the variables a, b, and c for the ratios 3, 5, and 7 respectively. The total amount of money is 3a + 5b + 7c = 180. Since the ratio is 3:5:7, we can let a = 3x, b = 5x, and c = 7x. Substituting these values into the equation, we get 3(3x) + 5(5x) + 7(7x) = 180. Simplifying the equation, we get 9x + 25x + 49x = 180. Combining like terms, we get 83x = 180. Solving for x, we get x = 180/83 = 2.17 (rounded to two decimal places). Now that we have the value of x, we can find the amount of money each person receives. a = 3x = 3(2.17) = 6.51, b = 5x = 5(2.17) = 10.85, and c = 7x = 7(2.17) = 15.19.

        "question": "A car travels from City A to City B at an average speed of 60 miles per hour and returns from City B to City A at an average speed of 40 miles per hour. What is the average speed of the round trip?",
        "answer": "To find the average speed of the round trip, we need to find the total distance traveled and the total time taken. Since the distance between the two cities is the same, let's call it d. The time taken to travel from City A to City B is d/60, and the time taken to travel from City B to City A is d/40. The total time is d/60 + d/40. To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator, which is 120. So, the total time is (2d + 3d)/120 = 5d/120. The average speed is total distance/total time, which is 2d / (5d/120) = 2d * 120 / 5d = 48. The answer is ###{48}."

        "question": "A car travels from city A to city B at an average speed of 60 miles per hour and returns from city B to city A at an average speed of 40 miles per hour. What is the average speed for the entire trip?",
        "answer": "To find the average speed for the entire trip, we need to find the total distance traveled and the total time taken. Since the distance from city A to city B is the same as the distance from city B to city A, let\\'s call it x. The time taken to travel from city A to city B is x/60, and the time taken to travel from city B to city A is x/40. The total time is the sum of these two times: x/60 + x/40. To find the total distance, we multiply the average speed by the total time: (60 + 40)/2 * (x/60 + x/40). We can simplify this expression to find the average speed: (100/2) * (4x + 3x) / (60 * 40) = (100/2) * (7x) / (2400) = 35x / 2400. Since the distance is the same for both trips, we can set up an equation: 2x = (35x / 2400) * 2 * 2400. Solving for x, we get x = 2400. Now that we know x, we can find the average speed: (60 + 40) / 2 = 100 / 2 = 50. Therefore, the average speed for the entire trip is ###{50} miles per hour."

        "answer": "To find the number of days it takes for the snail to reach the top of the well, we need to find the net distance the snail travels each day. The snail climbs 3 feet up and slips 2 feet back, so the net distance is 3 - 2 = 1 foot per day. To find the number of days it takes to climb 20 feet, we divide the total distance by the net distance: 20 / 1 = 20 days. Therefore, it will take the snail ###{20} days to reach the top of the well."

We know that the total number of pastries sold is 600, so we can write the equation: x + 6x = 600. Combining like terms, we get 7x = 600. Dividing both sides by 7, we get x = 85.86. Since x represents the number of fruit pastries sold, the bakery sold 85.86 fruit pastries. Answer is ####{85.86}"

        "answer": "To find the average speed of the round trip, we need to find the total distance traveled and divide it by the total time taken. Since the distance to and from city A and city B is the same, let\\'s call it x. The time taken to travel from city A to city B is x / 60 hours, and the time taken to travel back is x / 40 hours. The total time taken is x / 60 + x / 40. To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 120. So, the total time taken is (2x + 3x) / 120 = 5x / 120. The total distance traveled is 2x.

If they sell 80 more loaves of white bread than whole wheat bread, and the number of loaves of rye bread sold is 2/3 of the number of whole wheat bread sold, how many loaves of each type of bread were sold?",
        "answer": "Let's denote the number of whole wheat loaves as x. Since they sold 80 more loaves of white bread than whole wheat bread, the number of white loaves is x + 80. The number of rye loaves is 2/3 of the whole wheat loaves, which is (2/3)x. We know the total number of loaves is 480, so we can set up the equation x + (x + 80) + (2/3)x = 480. To solve for x, we need to combine like terms and solve the equation. First, we can combine the x terms: x + x + (2/3)x = (4/3)x. Now we have (4/3)x + 80 = 480. Next, we subtract 80 from both sides: (4/3)x = 400. Now we multiply both sides by 3/4 to solve for x: x = 300. Now that we have x, we can find the number of white loaves (x + 80) and the number of rye loaves (2/3x). The number of whole wheat loaves is 300. The number of white loaves is 300 + 80 = 380. The number of rye loaves is (2/3) * 300 = 200. The answer is ###{300, 380, 200}."

The time taken to travel from city A to city B is d / 60 and the time taken to return is d / 40. The total time taken for the round trip is d / 60 + d / 40. To find the average speed, we need to divide the total distance by the total time. Since the total distance is 2d, we can write the average speed as 2d / (d / 60 + d / 40). We can simplify this expression by finding a common denominator: 2d / (d / 60 + d / 40) = 2d / ((40d + 60d) / 1200) = 2d / (100d / 1200) = 2400 / 100 = 24.

We know the total amount of money is $900, so we can set up the equation 10x = 900. To solve for x, we divide both sides by 10: x = 900 / 10 = 90. Now that we have the value of x, we can find the amount of money the first person gets by multiplying 2 and x: 2 * 90 = 180. Similarly, we can find the amount of money the second person gets by multiplying 3 and x: 3 * 90 = 270. Finally, we can find the amount of money the third person gets by multiplying 5 and x: 5 * 90 = 450. The first person gets $180, the second person gets $270, and the third person gets $450.

        "answer": "To find the average speed, we need to find the total distance traveled and the total time taken. Since the distance from A to B is the same as from B to A, let\\'s call it d. The time taken to travel from A to B is d/60 and from B to A is d/40. The total time is d/60 + d/40. To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 120. So, the total time is (2d + 3d)/120 = 5d/120. The average speed is the total distance divided by the total time, which is 2d / (5d/120). We can cancel out d, leaving 2d * 120 / 5d = 240/5 = 48.

        "answer": "To find the number of days it will take for the snail to reach the top, we need to find the difference between the total height of the well and the distance the snail slips back each night. The snail climbs 2 feet up and slips 1 foot back, so it effectively moves 2 - 1 = 1 foot per day. It will take the snail 25 - 1 = 24 days to climb 24 feet, and on the 25th day, it will reach the top of the well. So, the answer is ###{25}."

        "answer": "First, we need to find the discount for each type of bread. The regular loaf has a 15% discount, which is 0.15 x $2.50 = $0.375. The sale price for the regular loaf is $2.50 - $0.375 = $2.125. The whole wheat loaf has a 20% discount, which is 0.20 x $3.25 = $0.65. The sale price for the whole wheat loaf is $3.25 - $0.65 = $2.60. To find the total price for 3 regular loaves, we multiply the sale price by 3: $2.125 x 3 = $6.375. To find the total price for 2 whole wheat loaves, we multiply the sale price by 2: $2.60 x 2 = $5.20. To find the total price for all 5 loaves, we add the prices together: $6.375 + $5.20 = $11.575.

The time it takes to travel to City B is x/60 and the time to return is x/40. The total time is x/60 + x/40. To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 120. So, the total time is (2x + 3x)/120 = 5x/120. The average speed is the total distance divided by the total time. The total distance is 2x. The average speed is 2x / (5x/120) = 2x * 120 / 5x = 240.

Since the average speed is the same in both directions, we can assume the distance between the two cities is the same. Let's call it d. The time taken to travel from City A to City B is d/60, and the time taken to return is d/40. The total time is d/60 + d/40. To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 120. So, the total time is (2d + 3d)/120 = 5d/120. The average speed is the total distance divided by the total time. The total distance is 2d, so the average speed is 2d / (5d/120) = 2d * 120 / 5d = 48.

If the number of muffins sold is represented by'm', write an equation to represent the situation and solve for'm'.', 'answer': \"Let's represent the number of cakes as 'c'. Since the number of muffins is 40% more than the number of cakes, we can write the equation m = c + 0.4c = 1.4c. We know that the total number of muffins and cakes is 480, so we can write the equation m + c = 480. Substituting m = 1.4c into the second equation, we get 1.4c + c = 480. Combining like terms, we get 2.4c = 480. To solve for c, we divide both sides by 2.4: c = 480 / 2.4 = 200. Since m = 1.4c, we can substitute c = 200 into the equation to get m = 1.4(200) = 280.

        "answer": "To find the average speed for the entire trip, we need to find the total distance traveled and the total time taken. The distance from City A to City B is the same as from City B to City A. Let\\'s call it d. The time taken to travel from City A to City B is d / 60 and the time taken to travel from City B to City A is d / 40. The total time taken is (d / 60) + (d / 40). The total distance is 2d. The average speed is total distance / total time. Average speed = 2d / ((d / 60) + (d / 40)). To simplify this expression, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by 120 to get 240d / (4d + 3d) = 240d / 7d = 240 / 7. So, the average speed is 240 / 7 km/h. Answer is ###{34}."

Since the distance from City A to City B is the same as the distance from City B to City A, let's call it d. The time taken to travel from City A to City B is d/60 hours and the time taken to travel from City B to City A is d/40 hours. The total time taken is d/60 + d/40. To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 120. So, the total time is (2d + 3d)/120 = 5d/120 = d/24 hours. The average speed is the total distance divided by the total time. Since the distance is d, the average speed is d / (d/24) = 24 miles per hour. The answer is ###{24}."

        "answer": "To find the average speed for the entire round trip, we need to add the distance traveled in each direction and divide by the total time taken. Since the distance is the same in both directions, we can use the formula: Average speed = 2 * distance / (time1 + time2). Since the time taken is inversely proportional to the speed, we can use the formula: time = distance/speed. So, time1 = distance/60 and time2 = distance/40. The average speed is then 2 * distance / (distance/60 + distance/40). This can be simplified to 2 * distance / ((4+3)/60) = 2 * distance * 60 / 7 = 120 * distance / 7. However, we are not given the distance, but the average speed. We can find the average speed by using the fact that the average speed is the harmonic mean of the two speeds. The harmonic mean is given by the formula: harmonic mean = 2ab / (a + b), where a and b are the two speeds. Therefore, the average speed = 2 * 60 * 40 / (60 + 40) = 4800 / 100 = 48 km/h.

The distance from city A to city B is the same as the distance from city B to city A. Let's call this distance d. The time it takes to travel from city A to city B is d / 60 and the time it takes to travel from city B to city A is d / 40. The total time is (d / 60) + (d / 40). To find the average speed, we need to find the total distance and divide it by the total time. The total distance is 2d. The total time is (d / 60) + (d / 40). To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 60 and 40 is 120. So, the total time is (2d / 120) + (3d / 120) = 5d / 120. The average speed is 2d / (5d / 120). To simplify this, we can cancel out d: 2 / (5 / 120) = 2 * (120 / 5) = 48. The average speed of the entire trip is 48 km/h. ###{48}"

Therefore, the number of more books that can be placed on the bookshelf is 40 - 120 = -80. However, since we cannot have a negative number of books, the bookshelf cannot hold any more books. ###{0}."

        "question": "A car travels from city A to city B at an average speed of 60 miles per hour and returns at an average speed of 40 miles per hour. What is the average speed of the round trip?",
        "answer": "To find the average speed of the round trip, we need to find the total distance traveled and the total time taken. Let's say the distance between city A and city B is d. The time taken to travel from A to B is d / 60, and the time taken to travel from B to A is d / 40. The total time taken is (d / 60) + (d / 40). We can find a common denominator, which is 120. So, the total time taken is (2d + 3d) / 120 = 5d / 120 = d / 24. The total distance traveled is 2d. The average speed is total distance / total time = 2d / (d / 24) = 2 * 24 = 48. ###{48}."

Dividing both sides by 10, we get x = 12. To find the amount of money the person with the ratio 5 will receive, we multiply the total amount by the ratio, which is 5x = 5 * 12 = 60. So, the person with the ratio 5 will receive $60. ###{60}."

        "answer": "To find the average speed of the car for the entire round trip, we need to find the total distance traveled and the total time taken. Since the distance from City A to City B is the same as from City B to City A, let's denote it as D. The time taken to travel from A to B is D/60 and from B to A is D/40. The total time taken is D/60 + D/40. To find the average speed, we need to divide the total distance by the total time. Average speed = total distance / total time = 2D / (D/60 + D/40). To simplify, we can find a common denominator for the fractions in the denominator, which is 120. Therefore, the average speed = 2D / ((2D + 3D)/120) = 2D * 120 / (5D) = 240 / 5 = 48.

        "answer": "The total number of parts in the ratio is 2+5+3 = 10. We know that the bakery sells 500 loaves per day. To find the number of loaves of rye bread, we need to find what fraction of the total is rye bread. Since the rye bread makes up 3 parts of the ratio, we can set up a proportion: 3/10 = x/500, where x is the number of rye loaves sold. Solving for x, we get x = (3/10)*500 = 150. So, the bakery sells 150 loaves of rye bread per day. Answer is ###{150}."

        "question": "A car travels from City A to City B at an average speed of 80 km/h and returns from City B to City A at an average speed of 60 km/h. What is the average speed for the entire round trip?",
        "answer": "The average speed is calculated by dividing the total distance traveled by the total time taken. Since the distance is the same in both directions, we can let the distance be d. Then the time taken to travel from A to B is d/80 and the time taken to travel from B to A is d/60. The total time is d/80 + d/60. The average speed is the total distance divided by the total time: (2d) / (d/80 + d/60) = (2d) / ((16d + 15d) / 480) = (2d * 480) / (31d) = 960/31.

The total time is (2d * 120) / (60 * 120) + (d * 120) / (40 * 120) = (240d + 120d) / 14400 = 360d / 14400. The average speed is 2d / (360d / 14400) = 2d * 14400 / 360d = 14400 / 360 = 40. Answer is ###{40}."

The time taken for the trip from A to B is x / 60 and the time taken for the return trip is x / 40. The total time is (x / 60) + (x / 40). To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 120. This gives us (2x / 120) + (3x / 120) = (5x / 120). The total time is 5x / 120. The average speed is the total distance divided by the total time. Since the distance is x, the average speed is x / (5x / 120) = 120 / 5 = 24 miles per hour. The answer is ###{24}."

        "answer": "To find the amount of money each person will get, we need to add the parts of the ratio together: 5 + 7 + 9 = 21. Then we divide the total amount of money by the sum of the parts: 1080 / 21 = 51.4285714286. But since the money has to be distributed to the people, we round down to the nearest whole number as you cannot distribute a fraction of money to people, so we round down to 51.

        "answer": "To find the total amount of sugar and flour needed, we need to calculate the amount needed for one batch and multiply it by 3. One batch requires 2/3 cup of sugar and 1/4 cup of flour. So, for 3 batches, they need 3 x 2/3 = 6/3 = 2 cups of sugar and 3 x 1/4 = 3/4 cups of flour. To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 4. So, we can rewrite 2 cups as 8/4 cups. Now we can add the fractions: 8/4 + 3/4 = 11/4 cups of sugar and 3/4 cups of flour. So, the total amount of sugar and flour needed is 11/4 cups of sugar and 3/4 cups of flour. Answer is ###{11/4, 3/4}."

        "answer": "The average speed of the entire trip is the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken. Since the distance to and from city A and B is the same, we can assume the distance is d. The time taken to travel from city A to city B is d / 60, and the time taken to travel from city B to city A is d / 40. The total time taken is (d / 60) + (d / 40). To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 120. So, we can rewrite the fractions as (2d / 120) + (3d / 120) = (5d / 120). The total distance traveled is 2d. So, the average speed is 2d / (5d / 120) = (2d * 120) / 5d = 240 / 5 = 48 km/h. So, the average speed of the entire trip is 48 km/h. ###{48}"

Since the distance from city A to city B is the same as the distance from city B to city A, let's call it x. The time taken to travel from city A to city B is x \u00f7 60 and the time taken to travel from city B to city A is x \u00f7 40. The total time taken is (x \u00f7 60) + (x \u00f7 40).

Since the car travels from A to B and back, the total distance is 2 times the distance from A to B. However, we don't know the distance from A to B. Let's assume the distance from A to B is x. Then, the total distance is 2x. The time taken to travel from A to B is x / 60 and from B to A is x / 40. The total time is x / 60 + x / 40. To find the average speed, we need to divide the total distance by the total time. The average speed is 2x / ((x / 60) + (x / 40)). We can simplify this expression by finding a common denominator, which is 120. So, the average speed is 2x / ((2x / 120) + (3x / 120)) = 2x / (5x / 120) = 2x * 120 / 5x = 240 / 5 = 48.

        "question": "A bakery sells a total of 480 loaves of bread per day from two stores. Store A sells 30% of the total loaves, and store B sells the rest. If store B sells 40 loaves per hour, how many hours did store B sell bread for?",
        "answer": "To find the number of hours store B sold bread for, we first need to determine how many loaves store B sells in a day. Since store A sells 30% of the total loaves, store B sells 100% - 30% = 70% of the total loaves. 70% of 480 is (70/100) x 480 = 336. Since store B sells 40 loaves per hour, we can find the number of hours by dividing the total loaves sold by the hourly rate. 336 / 40 = 8.4. So, store B sold bread for 8.4 hours. Answer is ###{8.4}."

        "answer": "The average speed is calculated as the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken. Since the distance is the same for both trips, let's denote the distance as d. The time taken to travel from City A to City B is d / 60 hours and the time taken to return is d / 40 hours. The total time taken is d / 60 + d / 40. The average speed is d / ((d / 60) + (d / 40)). We can simplify this expression by finding a common denominator: d / ((d * 40) / (60 * 40) + (d * 60) / (60 * 40)) = d / ((40d + 60d) / 2400) = d / (100d / 2400) = 2400 / 100 = 24.

        "answer": "To find the average speed of the car for the entire round trip, we need to find the total distance traveled and the total time taken. Since the car travels the same distance to and from City B, let's call the distance x. The time taken to travel from City A to City B is x / 60 and the time taken to travel from City B to City A is x / 40. The total time is x / 60 + x / 40. To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 120. So, we get (2x + 3x) / 120 = 5x / 120. The total distance is 2x. The average speed is total distance / total time = 2x / (5x / 120) = 240 / 5 = 48 miles per hour. Therefore, the average speed of the car for the entire round trip is ###{48}."

If they sold 3 times as many large boxes as small boxes, how many cookies were sold in total?",
        "answer": "Let\\'s assume the number of small boxes sold is x. Since they sold 3 times as many large boxes, the number of large boxes sold is 3x. The total number of cookies sold is the sum of the cookies from large and small boxes. The large boxes contributed 12 * 3x = 36x cookies, and the small boxes contributed 8x cookies. The total number of cookies sold is 36x + 8x = 44x. Since the total number of boxes sold is 480, we can write the equation: x + 3x = 480. Combine like terms to get 4x = 480. Divide both sides by 4 to find x: x = 480 / 4 = 120. Now we can find the total number of cookies sold: 44x = 44 * 120 = 5280 cookies. The answer is ###{5280}."

If they sell whole wheat bread at $2 per loaf and white bread at $1.50 per loaf, and they make a total of $840 from selling bread, how much profit do they make from selling white bread?",
        "answer": "To find the profit from selling white bread, we first need to find the number of white bread loaves sold. Let's say x is the number of white bread loaves sold. Since they sell a total of 240 loaves, the number of whole wheat bread loaves sold is 240 - x. The profit made from selling white bread is the money made from selling white bread minus the cost of white bread. The money made from selling white bread is 1.5x, and the cost of white bread is 1.5x. So, the profit made from selling white bread is 1.5x - 1.5x = 0. The profit made from selling whole wheat bread is 2(240 - x) - 2(240 - x) = 0. So, the total profit is 0. Answer is ###{0}."

        "answer": "Let x be the number of chocolate chip cookies sold. The total number of cookies sold is x + 3/5 * 480. Since the total number of cookies sold is 480, we can set up the equation x + 3/5 * 480 = 480. To solve for x, we need to isolate x. Subtract 3/5 * 480 from both sides: x = 480 - 3/5 * 480. To subtract a fraction from a whole number, we need to convert the whole number to a fraction with the same denominator. 480 = 2400/5. So, x = 2400/5 - 3/5 * 480. Now, we can subtract: x = 2400/5 - 1440/5. x = 960/5. x = 192. The answer is ###{192}."

        "answer": "To find the average speed of the car for the entire round trip, we need to find the total distance traveled and the total time taken. Let's assume the distance between the two cities is x km. The time taken to travel from city A to city B is x / 60 hours, and the time taken to travel from city B to city A is x / 40 hours. The total time taken for the round trip is x / 60 + x / 40. The average speed is the total distance divided by the total time. Since the distance is the same for both trips, the average speed is 2x / (x / 60 + x / 40). To simplify, we can find a common denominator for the fractions in the denominator, which is 120. So, the average speed is 2x / ((x * 2) / 120 + (x * 3) / 120) = 2x / ((2x + 3x) / 120) = 2x / (5x / 120) = 2x * 120 / 5x = 240 / 5 = 48 km/h. ###{48}"

        "question": "A bakery sells a total of 480 loaves of bread per day. They sell a combination of whole wheat and white bread. If they sell 60 more loaves of whole wheat bread than white bread, how many loaves of whole wheat bread do they sell in a day?",
        "answer": "Let\\'s denote the number of white bread loaves as x. Since they sell 60 more loaves of whole wheat bread, the number of whole wheat loaves is x + 60. The total number of loaves is the sum of white and whole wheat loaves, which is x + (x + 60) = 2x + 60. We know the total number of loaves is 480, so 2x + 60 = 480. Subtracting 60 from both sides gives 2x = 420. Dividing both sides by 2 gives x = 210. Since x is the number of white bread loaves, they sell 210 + 60 = 270 loaves of whole wheat bread. Therefore, the bakery sells ###{270} loaves of whole wheat bread per day."

        "answer": "Let's say they sold x loaves of white bread and (480 - x) loaves of whole wheat bread. The total amount of money made from selling white bread is 1.50x and from whole wheat bread is 2(480 - x). The total amount of money made is the sum of these two, which is equal to $840. So, we can set up the equation: 1.50x + 2(480 - x) = 840. Simplifying the equation, we get 1.50x + 960 - 2x = 840. Combining like terms, we get -0.50x + 960 = 840. Subtracting 960 from both sides, we get -0.50x = -120. Dividing both sides by -0.50, we get x = 240. So, they sold 240 loaves of white bread. The number of loaves of whole wheat bread is 480 - x = 480 - 240 = 240. ###{240}"

Since the distance from city A to city B is the same as from city B to city A, we can assume it to be x. The time taken to travel from city A to city B is x/60 and from city B to city A is x/40. The total distance is 2x and the total time is x/60 + x/40. To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 120. So, the total time is (2x + 3x)/120 = 5x/120. The average speed is total distance / total time = 2x / (5x/120) = 2x * 120 / 5x = 240/5 = 48. So, the average speed of the entire trip is 48 mph. Answer is ###{48}."

        "question": "A snail is at the bottom of a 20-foot well. Each day, it climbs up 3 feet, but at night, it slips back 2 feet. How many days will it take for the snail to reach the top of the well?",
        "answer": "To find the number of days it takes for the snail to reach the top, we need to calculate the net distance it travels each day. The snail climbs 3 feet up during the day and slips 2 feet back at night, so the net distance it travels each day is 3 - 2 = 1 foot. Since the snail starts at the bottom of the 20-foot well, it needs to climb 20 feet to reach the top. Therefore, it will take the snail 20 / 1 = 20 days to reach the top of the well. So, it will take the snail ###{20} days to reach the top of the well."

        "answer": "Let\\'s assume the common ratio is x. The total parts in the ratio are 2 + 3 + 5 = 10. We know that the total amount of money is $240. So, we can write the equation 2x + 3x + 5x = 240. Combining like terms, we get 10x = 240. Dividing both sides by 10, we get x = 24. Since the person with the ratio 5 gets 5x, they will get 5 * 24 = $120. So, the person with the ratio 5 will receive ###{120}."

        "question": "A man is 24 years older than his wife. 8 years from now, he will be twice as old as his wife. How old is the man now?",
        "answer": "Let\\'s assume the wife\\'s current age is x. The man is 24 years older than his wife, so the man\\'s current age is x + 24. Eight years from now, the wife will be x + 8 years old, and the man will be x + 24 + 8 = x + 32 years old. According to the problem, the man will be twice as old as his wife eight years from now, so we can write the equation x + 32 = 2(x + 8). Expanding the equation, we get x + 32 = 2x + 16. Subtracting x from both sides, we get 32 = x + 16. Subtracting 16 from both sides, we get 16 = x. So, the wife is currently 16 years old. Since the man is 24 years older than his wife, the man is 16 + 24 = 40 years old. So, the man is currently ###{40} years old."

Since the distance is the same for both the trip from City A to City B and the return trip, let's call it d. The time taken to travel from City A to City B is d/60 and the time taken to return is d/40. The total time taken is d/60 + d/40. To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 120. (d/60) * (2/2) + (d/40) * (3/3) = (2d/120) + (3d/120) = (5d/120). The total time is 5d/120. To find the average speed, we need to divide the total distance by the total time.

        "question": "A car travels from City A to City B at an average speed of 60 km/h and returns to City A at an average speed of 40 km/h. What is the average speed of the car for the entire trip?",
        "answer": "To find the average speed for the entire trip, we need to find the total distance traveled and divide it by the total time taken. Since the car travels from City A to City B and back, the total distance traveled is twice the distance from City A to City B. Let\\'s call this distance x. The time taken to travel from City A to City B is x / 60, and the time taken to travel back is x / 40. The total time is x / 60 + x / 40. To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 120. So, the total time is (2x + 3x) / 120 = 5x / 120. The average speed is the total distance divided by the total time. The total distance is 2x, and the total time is 5x / 120. So, the average speed is (2x) / (5x / 120) = 240 / 5 = 48. The answer is ###{48}."

The total number of loaves is the sum of white and whole wheat loaves, which is x + x/4. We know the total number of loaves is 480, so x + x/4 = 480. To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 4 to get 4x + x = 1920. This simplifies to 5x = 1920. To find x, we divide both sides by 5: x = 1920 / 5 = 384.

The time it takes to travel from city A to city B is d / 60 and the time it takes to travel from city B to city A is d / 40. The total time is (d / 60) + (d / 40). We can find a common denominator, which is 120. So, the total time is (2d / 120) + (3d / 120) = (5d / 120) = (d / 24). The average speed is the total distance divided by the total time, which is 2d / (d / 24) = 48 km/h. The answer is ###{48}."

Since the distance to and from City A and B is the same, we can consider it as 2 times the distance from City A to City B. Let\\'s call this distance x. The time taken to travel from City A to City B is x / 60 and the time taken to travel back is x / 40. The total time is (x / 60) + (x / 40). To find the average speed, we need to find the total distance (2x) and divide it by the total time. So, the average speed is (2x) / ((x / 60) + (x / 40)). To simplify this, we find the least common multiple of 60 and 40, which is 120. So, (2x) / ((x / 60) + (x / 40)) = (2x) / ((2x / 120) + (3x / 120)) = (2x) / (5x / 120) = (2x * 120) / (5x) = 240.

Since the distance from City A to City B is the same as the distance from City B to City A, we can call it d. The time taken to travel from City A to City B is d/60, and the time taken to travel from City B to City A is d/40. The total time taken is d/60 + d/40. To find the average speed, we need to divide the total distance by the total time. The average speed is (2d) / (d/60 + d/40). Simplifying this expression, we get (2d) / (d/60 + d/40) = (2d) / (8d/120 + 3d/120) = (2d) / (11d/120) = 240 / 11 = 21.81 mph (approximately).

        "question": "A car travels from city A to city B at an average speed of 60 km/h and returns from city B to city A at an average speed of 40 km/h. What is the average speed for the entire trip?",
        "answer": "To find the average speed for the entire trip, we need to find the total distance traveled and the total time taken. Since the car travels from city A to city B and back, the total distance is 2 times the distance from A to B. Let\\'s call the distance from A to B as d. The time taken to travel from A to B is d / 60 and the time taken to travel from B to A is d / 40. The total time is d / 60 + d / 40. To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 120. So, the total time is (2d + 3d) / 120 = 5d / 120 = d / 24. Therefore, the average speed is total distance / total time = 2d / (d / 24) = 48 km/h. Therefore, the average speed for the entire trip is ###{48}."

        "answer": "To find the number of days it will take for the snail to reach the top of the well, we need to find the net distance the snail travels each day. The snail climbs 3 feet up and slips 2 feet back, so the net distance is 3 - 2 = 1 foot per day. Since the well is 20 feet deep, the snail needs to travel 20 feet. To find the number of days, we divide the distance by the net distance per day. 20 feet / 1 foot per day = 20 days. Therefore, it will take ###{20} days for the snail to reach the top of the well."

        "answer": "To find the average speed of the round trip, we need to find the total distance traveled and divide it by the total time taken. Since the distances traveled in each direction are the same, we can find the average speed using the formula: Average speed = 2 * distance / (time taken + time taken). We can simplify this to: Average speed = 2 * distance / (2 * time taken). Since the distance is the same in both directions, we can simplify the formula to: Average speed = distance / time taken. We can use the formula distance = speed * time to find the time taken for one direction: Time = distance / speed = 60 / 40 = 1.5 hours. Now we can find the average speed: Average speed = distance / time taken = 60 / 1.5 = 40 km/h. Therefore, the average speed of the round trip is 40 km/h. ###{40}"

        "question": "A bookshelf has 5 shelves, and each shelf can hold 8 books. If 48 books are already on the bookshelf, what percentage of the bookshelf is filled?",
        "answer": "To find the percentage of the bookshelf filled, we first need to find the total capacity of the bookshelf. Since there are 5 shelves with 8 books each, the total capacity is 5 x 8 = 40 books. Next, we divide the number of books already on the bookshelf (48) by the total capacity (40) and multiply by 100 to convert to percentage. So, (48/40) * 100 = 120%. Answer is ###{120}."

If the number of boxes sold in the afternoon is 120 more than the number of boxes sold in the morning, what is the number of boxes sold in the morning?', 'answer': \"Let's say the number of boxes sold in the morning is x. Since the number of boxes sold in the afternoon is 120 more than in the morning, the number of boxes sold in the afternoon is x + 120. We know that the total number of boxes sold in a day is 480, so we can write an equation: x + (x + 120) = 480. Simplifying the equation, we get 2x + 120 = 480. Subtracting 120 from both sides gives us 2x = 360. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 180. So the number of boxes sold in the morning is 180.

        "answer": "To find the average speed of the whole trip, we need to find the total distance traveled and the total time taken. Since the distance is the same for both the forward and backward trips, let's assume the distance is x. The time taken to travel from city A to city B is x / 60, and the time taken to return is x / 40. The total time taken is x / 60 + x / 40. To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 120. The total time taken is (2x + 3x) / 120 = 5x / 120. The average speed is the total distance divided by the total time. The average speed is 2x / (5x / 120) = 2x * 120 / 5x = 240 / 5 = 48. Therefore, the average speed of the whole trip is 48 km/h. ###{48}"

        "question": "A car travels from city A to city B at an average speed of 60 miles per hour and returns from city B to city A at an average speed of 40 miles per hour. What is the average speed of the entire trip?",
        "answer": "To find the average speed, we need to find the total distance traveled and the total time taken. Since the distance from A to B is the same as the distance from B to A, we can call it x. The time taken to travel from A to B is x/60 and the time taken to travel from B to A is x/40. The total time is x/60 + x/40 = (2x + 3x)/120 = 5x/120 = x/24. The total distance is 2x. So, the average speed is 2x / (x/24) = 48 miles per hour. Answer is ###{48}."

Then, we need to find the value of each part by dividing the total amount by the total number of parts: 480 / 16 = 30. Finally, we multiply the value of each part by the ratio of the person: 8 * 30 = 240. Therefore, the person with the ratio 8 will receive $240. Answer is ###{240}.', {'question': 'A car travels from city A to city B at an average speed of 60 km/h and returns at an average speed of 40 km/h. What is the average speed for the round trip?', 'answer': 'To find the average speed for the round trip, we need to find the total distance traveled and the total time taken. Since the distance from city A to city B is the same as the distance from city B to city A, let's call it x. The time taken to travel from city A to city B is x / 60 and the time taken to travel from city B to city A is x / 40. The total time taken is x / 60 + x / 40. To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 120. So, the total time taken is (2x + 3x) / 120 = 5x / 120. The average speed is the total distance divided by the total time. Since the distance is x, the average speed is x / (5x / 120) = 120 / 5 = 24 km/h. Therefore, the average speed for the round trip is 24 km/h. Answer is ###{24}."

        "answer": "Let's assume the number of white bread is x. Then, the number of whole wheat bread is x - 20% of x. We know that the total number of bread is 480. So, x + (x - 20% of x) = 480. We can simplify this to x + 0.8x = 480. Combine like terms to get 1.8x = 480. Now, divide by 1.8 to get x = 266.67. But we can't sell a fraction of a bread, so we round down to the nearest whole number. The number of white bread is 266. The number of whole wheat bread is 266 - 20% of 266 = 266 - 0.2 * 266 = 266 - 53.2 = 212.8. But we can't sell a fraction of a bread, so we round down to the nearest whole number.

        "question": "A bakery sells a total of 480 loaves of bread per day. They sell whole wheat bread for $2 each and white bread for $1.50 each. If they made a total of $840, how many loaves of bread did they sell in total?",
        "answer": "Let's denote the number of whole wheat bread as x and the number of white bread as y. We know that x + y = 480 (total loaves sold) and 2x + 1.5y = 840 (total money made). We can solve this system of equations by multiplying the second equation by 100 to get rid of the decimal, which gives us 200x + 150y = 84000. Then, we can multiply the first equation by 1.5 to get 1.5x + 1.5y = 720. Subtracting this equation from the second equation, we get 198.5x = 81600. Solving for x, we get x = 411. Now, substituting x into the first equation, we get 411 + y = 480, so y = 69. Therefore, they sold a total of 480 loaves of bread. Answer is ###{480}."

        "question": "A bookshelf has 5 shelves, and each shelf can hold a maximum of 8 books. If the bookshelf is currently empty and 120 books are to be placed on it, how many shelves will be completely filled?",
        "answer": "Let's denote the number of shelves filled as x. Since each shelf can hold 8 books, we can set up the equation 8x \u2264 120. To solve for x, we divide both sides of the inequality by 8, which gives us x \u2264 15. Since x must be an integer, the maximum number of shelves that can be filled is 15. However, this is not possible because there are only 5 shelves. So, we need to find the largest integer less than or equal to 15 that is also less than or equal to 5. This is 5. Therefore, 5 shelves will be completely filled. Answer is ###{5}."

If they sell 8 more loaves of white bread than whole wheat and the ratio of whole wheat to white bread is 4:5, let x be the number of whole wheat loaves sold. The number of white bread loaves sold is 5x + 8. We know that the total number of loaves is 150, so we can write the equation 4x + 5x + 8 = 150. Combining like terms, we get 9x + 8 = 150. Subtracting 8 from both sides gives us 9x = 142. Dividing both sides by 9 gives us x = 142 / 9 = 15.83. Since we can't sell a fraction of a loaf, we round down to the nearest whole number.

        "answer": "We can solve the system of equations by multiplying the second equation by 2 and then adding it to the first equation. This will eliminate the y variable.\\nFirst, we multiply the second equation by 2: 2(2x - 3y) = 2(-2)\\nThis simplifies to 4x - 6y = -4.\\nNow we add the first equation to this new equation: (4x + 2y) + (4x - 6y) = 12 + (-4)\\nThis simplifies to 8x - 4y = 8.\\nNext, we multiply the first equation by 2: 2(4x + 2y) = 2(12)\\nThis simplifies to 8x + 4y = 24.\\nNow we add the two equations together: (8x - 4y) + (8x + 4y) = 8 + 24\\nThis simplifies to 16x = 32.\\nFinally, we divide both sides by 16: x = 32/16 = <<32/16=2>>2\\nNow that we know x, we can substitute it into one of the original equations to solve for y. Let's use the first equation: 4x + 2y = 12\\n4(2) + 2y = 12\\n8 + 2y = 12\\nSubtracting 8 from both sides gives 2y = 4.\\nDividing both sides by 2 gives y = 2.\\n#### 2"
