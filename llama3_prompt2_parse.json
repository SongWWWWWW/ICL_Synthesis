        "question": "A bakery sells a total of 240 loaves of bread. They sell 4 more loaves of whole wheat bread than white bread. If they sell 60 loaves of white bread, how many loaves of whole wheat bread do they sell?",
        "answer": "Let's say the number of whole wheat bread loaves is x. Since they sell 4 more loaves of whole wheat bread than white bread, we can set up the equation x + 60 = 240. To find the value of x, we subtract 60 from both sides of the equation: x = 240 - 60 = 180. Therefore, the bakery sells 180 loaves of whole wheat bread. Answer is ###{180}."

The ratio of whole wheat to rye to white is 2:3:5, so the number of loaves of whole wheat and rye combined is 2 + 3 = 5. Since the total number of loaves is 240, the number of loaves of whole wheat and rye combined is 5/8 of 240, which is 150. So, the number of loaves of white bread is 240 - 150 = 90.

A loaf of white bread normally costs $1.75, but it's on sale for 20% off. If Sarah buys 2 loaves of whole wheat bread and 3 loaves of white bread, how much will she pay in total?",
        "answer": "The original price of 2 loaves of whole wheat bread is 2 x $2.50 = $<<2*2.5=5>>5. The discount is 15% of 5 = 0.15 x 5 = <<0.15*5=0.75>>0.75. So, the sale price is 5 - 0.75 = <<5-0.75=4.25>>4.25. The original price of 3 loaves of white bread is 3 x $1.75 = $<<3*1.75=5.25>>5.25. The discount is 20% of 5.25 = 0.20 x 5.25 = <<0.2*5.25=1.05>>1.05. So, the sale price is 5.25 - 1.05 = <<5.25-1.05=4.2>>4.20. The total price Sarah pays is 4.25 + 4.20 = <<4.25+4.2=8.45>>8.45.

        "answer": "Let's say the number of loaves of white bread is x. Then, the number of loaves of whole wheat is x + 20. The total number of loaves of bread is 240. So, x + (x + 20) = 240. Simplifying the equation, we get 2x + 20 = 240. Subtracting 20 from both sides, we get 2x = 220. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 110. So, the number of loaves of white bread is 110.

        "answer": "The cafe buys 20% of 120 loaves, which is 20/100 * 120 = 24 loaves. The discount is 15% of the original price, so the cafe pays 85% of the original price. The original price is 100% - 15% = 85% of the original price. The cafe pays 85% of the original price for 24 loaves. 85% of the original price is 85/100 * x = 0.85x. So, 0.85x = 24.

        "question": "A bakery sells a total of 240 loaves of bread per day. They sell a combination of whole wheat and white bread. If they sell 30 more loaves of whole wheat than white bread, and each loaf of whole wheat is 2 dollars more expensive than each loaf of white bread, how much more money do they make from whole wheat bread per day?",
        "answer": "Let's say the number of loaves of white bread sold is x. Then, the number of loaves of whole wheat bread sold is x + 30. The total number of loaves sold is 240, so we can set up the equation: x + (x + 30) = 240. Simplifying the equation, we get 2x + 30 = 240. Subtracting 30 from both sides gives us 2x = 210. Dividing both sides by 2 gives us x = 105. So, they sell 105 loaves of white bread and 105 + 30 = 135 loaves of whole wheat bread. The difference in price between whole wheat and white bread is 2 dollars, so the difference in revenue is 135 x 2 = 270 dollars. Answer is ###{270}."

We know that w + (d+20) + (d+20) + (d+20) + (d+20) + d = 250\nCombine like terms: 5d + 4w = 250\nSubtract 4w from both sides: 5d = 250 - 4w\nDivide both sides by 5: d = (250 - 4w)/5\nWe are given that d = 30 on the first day, so 30 = (250 - 4w)/5\nMultiply both sides by 5: 150 = 250 - 4w\nSubtract 250 from both sides: -100 = -4w\nDivide both sides by -4: w = 25\nSo, the bakery sells 25 loaves on weekends.

        "answer": "Let's first find the number of loaves of whole wheat bread sold. If they sell 30% more whole wheat bread than white bread, then the number of whole wheat loaves is 75 + 75 x 30% = 75 + 75 x 0.3 = 75 + 22.5 = 97.5. Since you can't sell a fraction of a loaf, we round up to the nearest whole number. So, they sell 98 loaves of whole wheat bread. The total number of loaves sold is 75 + 98 = 173.

        "answer": "Let's find the total rate at which the 6 pipes fill the tank. 3 pipes fill at 40 liters per minute, so that's 3 x 40 = 120 liters per minute. 2 pipes fill at 30 liters per minute, so that's 2 x 30 = 60 liters per minute. 1 pipe fills at 20 liters per minute. So, the total rate is 120 + 60 + 20 = 200 liters per minute. The tank holds 1200 liters, so we divide 1200 by 200 to find the time it takes to fill the tank: 1200 / 200 = 6 minutes.

The total number of loaves is 240, so 1/3 of the total is 240/3 = 80. Since 2/3 of the bread is sold to the restaurant, 2/3 of the total is 2/3 * 240 = 160.
