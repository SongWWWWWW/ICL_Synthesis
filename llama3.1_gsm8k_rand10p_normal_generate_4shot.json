If they sell 3/5 of their bread as whole wheat and the rest as white bread, how many loaves of whole wheat bread did they sell?', 'answer': \"Since they sell 3/5 of their bread as whole wheat, they sell 4/5 as white bread. Let's find 1/5 of the total bread first: 480 / 5 = 96 loaves. Now, we can find the number of whole wheat loaves by multiplying 3/5 with the total number of loaves: 3/5 x 480 = (3 x 96) = 288.

Since the number of chocolate chip cookies is 1/4 of the total number of cookies, we can write an equation: x + (x + 60) = 480. Simplifying the equation, we get 2x + 60 = 480. Subtracting 60 from both sides, we get 2x = 420. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 210. So, the number of chocolate chip cookies sold is 210.

The first pipe fills 2/3 of a tank per hour, and the second pipe fills 1/4 of a tank per hour. To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 12. So, the first pipe fills 8/12 of a tank per hour, and the second pipe fills 3/12 of a tank per hour. The combined rate is 8/12 + 3/12 = 11/12 of a tank per hour. To find the time it takes to fill the tank, we can divide 1 (the whole tank) by 11/12. This is the same as multiplying by the reciprocal, which is 12/11.

Since 5 shelves will be full, the remaining books will be 15 - 5 = 10. But we know that 120 is evenly distributed, so the remaining books will be 0. So, the number of shelves that will still be empty is 0. However, we can't have a fraction of a shelf, so we need to find the remainder when 120 is divided by 8. 120 / 8 = 15 with a remainder of 0.

Since the number of blueberry muffins is 5x, we multiply 5 and 60 to get 5 x 60 = 300. The bakery sold 300 blueberry muffins. ###{300}\"}, {'question': 'A water tank can hold 2400 liters of water. If 3/5 of the tank is already filled and 120 liters of water are added, how much more water can be added to the tank?', 'answer': 'Since 3/5 of the tank is filled, we need to find 2/5 of the tank to determine how much more water can be added. To find 2/5 of the tank, we multiply 2400 by 2/5. 2/5 of 2400 is (2/5) x 2400 = (2 x 480) = 960. Therefore, 960 liters more can be added to the tank. Answer is ###{960}.'}, {'question': 'A bakery sells a total of 480 boxes of cookies in a day. They sell a combination of large boxes containing 24 cookies each and small boxes containing 12 cookies each. If the number of large boxes sold is 15 more than the number of small boxes sold, how many large and small boxes were sold in total?', 'answer': \"Let's denote the number of small boxes as x. Then the number of large boxes is x + 15. Since each large box has 24 cookies and each small box has 12 cookies, the total number of cookies is 24(x + 15) + 12x. We know this total is 480, so we can set up the equation 24(x + 15) + 12x = 480. Simplifying the equation, we get 36x + 360 = 480. Subtracting 360 from both sides gives us 36x = 120. Dividing both sides by 36, we get x = 10. So, the number of small boxes is 10 and the number of large boxes is 10 + 15 = 25. The total number of boxes sold is 10 + 25 = 35.

If a customer buys 3 loaves of bread, they get a quarter of a loaf free. If a customer buys 6 loaves of bread, how many loaves will they actually get?', 'answer': \"Let's consider the first case where a customer buys 2 loaves of bread and gets a third loaf free. This means they get 2 + 2/3 = 8/3 loaves for the price of 2. For the second case, a customer buys 3 loaves of bread and gets a quarter of a loaf free. This means they get 3 + 1/4 = 13/4 loaves for the price of 3. For the third case, a customer buys 6 loaves of bread. To make the calculation simple, let's first calculate how many sets of 2 and 3 loaves can be formed from 6 loaves. 6 loaves can be divided into 2 sets of 3 loaves and 0 sets of 2 loaves. So, the customer gets 0 x (13/4) + 3 x (8/3) = 0 + 8 = 8 loaves of bread.

Let's assume the distance between City A and City B is d. The time taken to travel from City A to City B is d/60 and the time taken to travel from City B to City A is d/40. The total distance is 2d and the total time is d/60 + d/40. To add these fractions, we find the least common denominator, which is 120. So, the total time is (2d + 3d)/120 = 5d/120 = d/24. The average speed is the total distance divided by the total time, which is 2d / (d/24) = 48. The answer is ###{48}.'}, {'question': 'A rectangular garden measures 20 meters by 15 meters.

The length of the larger rectangle is 20 + 2 + 2 = 24 meters and the width is 15 + 2 + 2 = 19 meters. The area of the larger rectangle is 24 x 19 = 456 square meters.
