        "answer": "Since they sell 3/5 of their bread as whole wheat, they sell 4/5 as white bread. Let's find 1/5 of the total bread first: 480 / 5 = 96 loaves. Now, we can find the number of whole wheat loaves by multiplying 3/5 with the total number of loaves: 3/5 x 480 = (3 x 96) = 288. Therefore, the bakery sold 288 loaves of whole wheat bread. ###{288}"

If the number of sugar cookies sold is 60 more than the number of chocolate chip cookies, and the number of chocolate chip cookies sold is 1/4 of the total number of cookies sold, how many sugar cookies were sold?",
        "answer": "Let's denote the number of chocolate chip cookies as x. Since the number of chocolate chip cookies is 1/4 of the total number of cookies, we can write an equation: x + (x + 60) = 480. Simplifying the equation, we get 2x + 60 = 480. Subtracting 60 from both sides, we get 2x = 420. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 210. So, the number of chocolate chip cookies sold is 210. Since the number of sugar cookies is 60 more than the number of chocolate chip cookies, the number of sugar cookies is 210 + 60 = 270. Answer is ###{270}."

        "question": "A water tank can be filled by two pipes, one filling the tank at a rate of 2/3 of a tank per hour and the other filling the tank at a rate of 1/4 of a tank per hour. How long will it take to fill the tank if both pipes are used together?",
        "answer": "To find the combined rate at which the two pipes fill the tank, we need to add their individual rates. The first pipe fills 2/3 of a tank per hour, and the second pipe fills 1/4 of a tank per hour. To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 12. So, the first pipe fills 8/12 of a tank per hour, and the second pipe fills 3/12 of a tank per hour. The combined rate is 8/12 + 3/12 = 11/12 of a tank per hour. To find the time it takes to fill the tank, we can divide 1 (the whole tank) by 11/12. This is the same as multiplying by the reciprocal, which is 12/11. So, the time it takes to fill the tank is 12/11 hours. Answer is ######{12/11}."

        "answer": "To find the number of shelves that will still be empty, we need to divide the total number of books by the number of books each shelf can hold. 120 books / 8 books per shelf = 15. Since 5 shelves will be full, the remaining books will be 15 - 5 = 10. But we know that 120 is evenly distributed, so the remaining books will be 0. So, the number of shelves that will still be empty is 0. However, we can't have a fraction of a shelf, so we need to find the remainder when 120 is divided by 8. 120 / 8 = 15 with a remainder of 0. So, all 5 shelves will be full and there will be 0 empty shelves. Answer is ###{0}."

        "answer": "Maya already has $120. She will save half of her weekly allowance, which is $20 / 2 = $<<20/2=10>>10 per week. Since she will save for 4 weeks, she will save a total of $10 x 4 = $<<10*4=40>>40. So, the total amount she will have saved is $120 + $40 = $160. To find out how much more money she needs to save, we subtract the total amount she has from the cost of the bike: $240 - $160 = $<<240-160=80>>80. Maya needs to save $80 more to buy the bike. ###{80}"

        "answer": "To find the total number of liters being added to the tank per minute, we need to multiply the number of people filling the tank by the rate at which they are filling it. 3 people are filling the tank at a rate of 5 liters per minute, so they add 3 x 5 = 15 liters per minute. To find the total number of liters being drained from the tank per minute, we need to multiply the number of people draining the tank by the rate at which they are draining it. 2 people are draining the tank at a rate of 2 liters per minute, so they drain 2 x 2 = 4 liters per minute. To find the net number of liters being added to the tank per minute, we need to subtract the number of liters being drained from the number of liters being added. So, the net number of liters being added per minute is 15 - 4 = 11 liters. To find the time it will take to fill the tank, we need to divide the total capacity of the tank by the net number of liters being added per minute. So, it will take 2400 / 11 = 218.18 minutes. ###{218}"

        "answer": "Let's denote the number of small boxes as x. Then the number of large boxes is x + 15. Since each large box has 24 cookies and each small box has 12 cookies, the total number of cookies is 24(x + 15) + 12x. We know this total is 480, so we can set up the equation 24(x + 15) + 12x = 480. Simplifying the equation, we get 36x + 360 = 480. Subtracting 360 from both sides gives us 36x = 120.

        "answer": "Let's consider the first case where a customer buys 2 loaves of bread and gets a third loaf free. This means they get 2 + 2/3 = 8/3 loaves for the price of 2. For the second case, a customer buys 3 loaves of bread and gets a quarter of a loaf free. This means they get 3 + 1/4 = 13/4 loaves for the price of 3. For the third case, a customer buys 6 loaves of bread. To make the calculation simple, let's first calculate how many sets of 2 and 3 loaves can be formed from 6 loaves. 6 loaves can be divided into 2 sets of 3 loaves and 0 sets of 2 loaves. So, the customer gets 0 x (13/4) + 3 x (8/3) = 0 + 8 = 8 loaves of bread. Answer is ###{8}."

        "answer": "Let's denote the number of white bread loaves as W and the number of whole wheat bread loaves as WW. We know that W + WW = 480 and WW = W + 0.30W = 1.30W. Substituting WW in the first equation, we get W + 1.30W = 480. Combining like terms, we get 2.30W = 480. To find W, we divide both sides by 2.30, so W = 480 / 2.30 = 208.7.

Then, we need to find out how much water leaks out while the tank is being filled to 1/4. 240 x 1/4 = 60 gallons. Since 144 - 60 = 84 gallons are left, we need to find out how long it will take to fill 84 gallons. The rate of water leaking out is 2 gallons per minute, so the rate of water filling the tank is 240 - 2 = 238 gallons per minute. To find the time, we divide the amount of water needed by the rate of filling: 84 / 238 = 0.353 hours. Converting this to minutes, we get 0.353 x 60 = 21.18 minutes. So, it will take approximately 21.18 minutes. Answer is ###{21}."

        "answer": "Let's assume the number of white bread loaves sold is x. Since 3/5 of the total bread sold is whole wheat, 2/5 is white bread. We can set up the equation: 2/5 * 480 = x + 60.\nTo solve for x, we first find 2/5 * 480 = 192.

        "answer": "Let's assume the number of white loaves is 4x and the number of whole wheat loaves is 5x. We know that the total number of loaves is 480, so 4x + 5x = 480. Combining like terms, we get 9x = 480. To find the value of x, we divide both sides by 9: x = 480 / 9 = 53.33. Since we can't sell a fraction of a loaf, we round down to 53.

        "answer": "To find the sale price of each loaf, we need to calculate 15% of the regular loaf and 20% of the whole wheat loaf. 15% of $2.50 is $2.50 x 0.15 = $0.375. The sale price of the regular loaf is $2.50 - $0.375 = $2.125. 20% of $3.25 is $3.25 x 0.20 = $0.65. The sale price of the whole wheat loaf is $3.25 - $0.65 = $2.60.

They sell 240 loaves per day and work 7 days a week, so they sell 240 x 7 = 1680 loaves per week. They work 4 weeks a month, so they sell 1680 x 4 = 6720 loaves per month.

        "answer": "Let's denote the number of oatmeal cookies as 3x and the number of sugar cookies as 5x. Since the ratio of sugar cookies to oatmeal cookies is 5:3, the number of sugar cookies is 5/3 times the number of oatmeal cookies. We are also given that they sell 120 more sugar cookies than oatmeal cookies. This can be expressed as 5x - 3x = 120. Solving for x, we get 2x = 120, x = 60.

        "answer": "Let's represent the number of large boxes as x. Since the number of small boxes is 3 times the number of large boxes, the number of small boxes is 3x. The total number of boxes is the sum of small and large boxes, which is 3x + x = 4x. We know the total number of boxes is 480, so 4x = 480.

To find the difference, we need to convert both fractions to decimals. 2 3/4 is equal to 2.75 and 2 1/4 is equal to 2.25. Now, we can subtract: 2.75 - 2.25 = 0.5. So, she needs 0.5 cups more of flour. Now, let's find out how much sugar she needs. She already has 1 cup, but she needs 1 1/2 cups. 1 1/2 is equal to 1.5. Now, we can subtract: 1.5 - 1 = 0.5. So, she needs 0.5 cups more of sugar. To find the total amount of flour and sugar she needs, we need to add 0.5 + 0.5 = 1. So, she needs ###{1} cup in total."

        "answer": "Let's represent the number of whole wheat bread as 5x and the number of white bread as 3x. Since the total number of loaves is 480, we can set up the equation 5x + 3x = 480. Combining like terms, we get 8x = 480. Dividing both sides by 8, we get x = 60. So, the number of whole wheat bread sold per day is 5x = 5 x 60 = 300. Answer is ###{300}."

        "answer": "The tank can hold 2400 liters. 3/4 of the tank is filled in the morning, which is 2400 * (3/4) = 1800 liters. 1/4 of the tank is filled in the afternoon, which is 2400 * (1/4) = 600 liters. The total amount of water in the tank is 1800 + 600 = 2400 liters. However, this is the same as the tank's capacity, so we need to find the remaining amount of water in the tank. Since 3/4 of the tank is filled, 1/4 of the tank is empty. So, the amount of water in the tank is 2400 - (2400 * (1/4)) = 2400 - 600 = 1800 liters. Answer is ###{1800}."

        "answer": "Let's use the ratio to set up an equation. Let c be the number of chocolate chip cookies and o be the number of oatmeal raisin cookies. We know that c + o = 480 and c/o = 5/3. We can rewrite the ratio as c = (5/3)o. Substituting this into the first equation, we get (5/3)o + o = 480. Multiplying both sides by 3, we get 5o + 3o = 1440. Combining like terms, we get 8o = 1440. Dividing both sides by 8, we get o = 180. Now that we know o, we can find c: c = (5/3)o = (5/3)(180) = 300. So, 300 chocolate chip cookies were sold. Answer is ###{300}."

        "answer": "Let's say the number of white bread loaves is x. Since they sell 60 more whole wheat loaves, the number of whole wheat loaves is x + 60. We know that the total number of loaves is 480, so we can set up the equation x + (x + 60) = 480. Combining like terms, we get 2x + 60 = 480. Subtracting 60 from both sides, we get 2x = 420. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 210. So, they sell 210 loaves of white bread. The difference between the number of whole wheat loaves and white bread loaves is 120 - 210 = <<120-210=-90>>-90. The bakery sells 90 fewer loaves of white bread than whole wheat bread. ###{-90}."

Since the total number of cookies sold is 480, we can set up the equation x + 1.3x = 480. Combining like terms, we get 2.3x = 480. To solve for x, we divide both sides by 2.3, which gives us x = 480 / 2.3 = 208.7. Since we can't sell a fraction of a box, we round down to 208 boxes.

So the sale price for the regular loaf is $2.50 - $0.375 = $2.125. The whole wheat loaf has a discount of 20% off $3.25, which is 0.20 * 3.25 = $0.65 off. So the sale price for the whole wheat loaf is $3.25 - $0.65 = $2.60. The total cost of the two loaves before tax is $2.125 + $2.60 = $4.725. Now we need to add the 8% sales tax. 8% of $4.725 is 0.08 * 4.725 = $0.378. So the total cost with tax is $4.725 + $0.378 = $5.103. Therefore, the total cost is ###{5.103}."

        "answer": "The snail climbs 3 feet up and slips 2 feet back each day, so it effectively climbs 3 - 2 = 1 foot per day. To find the number of days it takes to reach the top, we need to subtract the height it climbs in the last day from the total height. The snail climbs 19 feet in 19 days (20 - 1), and on the 20th day, it climbs the last foot to the top. Therefore, it will take the snail ###{20} days to reach the top of the well."

If the number of oatmeal raisin cookies sold is 40% of the total and the rest are chocolate chip cookies, how many chocolate chip cookies were sold?",
        "answer": "Let C be the number of chocolate chip cookies sold. Since the oatmeal raisin cookies are 40% of the total, the chocolate chip cookies make up 100% - 40% = 60% of the total. We can write this as C / (C + 0.4 * 480) = 0.6. Multiply both sides by (C + 0.4 * 480) to get C = 0.6 * (C + 0.4 * 480). Expanding the right side gives C = 0.6C + 0.288. Subtract 0.6C from both sides to get 0.4C = 0.288. Divide both sides by 0.4 to get C = 0.288 / 0.4 = 0.72 * 100 = 72. Thus, the bakery sold ###{72} chocolate chip cookies."

        "answer": "Let's say the number of white bread loaves sold is x. Since they sell 3/4 as many whole wheat loaves as white bread loaves, the number of whole wheat loaves sold is 3/4*x. The total number of loaves sold is the sum of white and whole wheat loaves, which is x + 3/4*x = 480. Combining like terms, we get 7/4*x = 480. To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 4/7, giving us x = 480 * 4/7 = 273.43 (round down to 273 since we can't sell a fraction of a loaf). So, the bakery sells 273 loaves of white bread. To find the number of whole wheat loaves, we multiply 273 by 3/4, which is 273 * 3/4 = 204.5 (round down to 204). The bakery sells 273 white bread loaves and 204 whole wheat loaves.

        "answer": "Let's represent the number of white bread loaves as x. Since they sell 30 more loaves of whole wheat bread, the number of whole wheat loaves is x + 30. We know the total number of loaves is 250, so we can write the equation x + (x + 30) = 250. Combining like terms, we get 2x + 30 = 250. Subtracting 30 from both sides, we get 2x = 220. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 110. Since x represents the number of white bread loaves, the number of whole wheat loaves is x + 30 = 110 + 30 = 140. The bakery sold 140 loaves of whole wheat bread. ###{140}."

        "question": "A bakery is having a sale on bread. A regular loaf of bread normally costs $2.50, but it's on sale for 15% off. A whole wheat loaf normally costs $3.25, but it's on sale for 20% off. If a customer buys 2 regular loaves and 1 whole wheat loaf, how much will they pay in total?",
        "answer": "To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the regular loaves and the whole wheat loaf separately, then add them together. The regular loaves are on sale for 15% off, so the discount is 0.15 x $2.50 = $0.375 per loaf. The sale price of each regular loaf is $2.50 - $0.375 = $2.125. Since the customer buys 2 regular loaves, the total cost for the regular loaves is 2 x $2.125 = $4.25. The whole wheat loaf is on sale for 20% off, so the discount is 0.20 x $3.25 = $0.65. The sale price of the whole wheat loaf is $3.25 - $0.65 = $2.60. Therefore, the total cost of the whole wheat loaf is $2.60. Adding the cost of the regular loaves and the whole wheat loaf, we get $4.25 + $2.60 = $6.85. Answer is ###{6.85}."

        "answer": "Let's denote the number of white bread loaves as x. We are given that the number of whole wheat loaves is 15 more than white loaves, so the number of whole wheat loaves is x + 15. We also know that the total number of loaves is 250. Therefore, we can write the equation x + (x + 15) = 250. Simplifying the equation, we get 2x + 15 = 250. Subtracting 15 from both sides, we get 2x = 235. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 117.5. However, we cannot have a fraction of a loaf, so we round down to the nearest whole number, x = 117. Therefore, the bakery sells 117 loaves of white bread. Answer is ###{117}."

        "answer": "The snail climbs 3 feet in the day and slips back 2 feet at night, so the net distance it covers in a day is 3 - 2 = 1 foot. To find the number of days it will take for the snail to reach the top of the well, we divide the total distance (30 feet) by the net distance covered in a day (1 foot). 30 \u00f7 1 = 30. However, this is not the correct answer because the snail will reach the top of the well on the 30th day, but we must consider that on the 29th day it will climb 3 feet and reach the top of the well. So, it will take the snail 29 days to reach the top of the well. Answer is ###{29}."

Since they sold 480 boxes in total, and 480 / 12 = <<480/12=40>>40 boxes were small boxes, the remaining boxes must be large boxes. So, 480 - 40 = <<480-40=440>>440 boxes were large boxes. Since each large box has 18 cookies, we can find the total number of large boxes by dividing 440 by 18. 440 / 18 = <<440/18=24.44>>24.44. Since we can't sell a fraction of a box, we round down to 24.

So, W + (W + 120) = 480. Combine like terms: 2W + 120 = 480. Subtract 120 from both sides: 2W = 360. Divide both sides by 2: W = 180.

The total money made from rye bread is 1.5(480 - x). We know that the total money made is $960, so we can write an equation: 2x + 1.5(480 - x) = 960. Simplifying the equation, we get 2x + 720 - 1.5x = 960. Combining like terms, we get 0.5x = 240. Dividing both sides by 0.5, we get x = 480. The number of whole wheat bread sold is 480.

Now, we need to subtract the discount from the original price to get the sale price. $2.50 - $0.375 = $2.125. Now, we need to multiply the sale price by 4 to get the total cost. $2.125 x 4 = $<<2.125*4=8.5>>8.50. Therefore, you will pay $8.50 for 4 loaves of bread during the sale. ###{8.50}"

        "question": "A bookshelf has 5 shelves, and each shelf can hold 8 books. If the bookshelf is currently empty and 120 books are added to it, how many books can the bookshelf hold in total?",
        "answer": "To find the total number of books the bookshelf can hold, we need to multiply the number of shelves by the number of books each shelf can hold. The bookshelf has 5 shelves, and each shelf can hold 8 books. So, the total number of books the bookshelf can hold is 5 x 8 = 40. However, we know that 120 books are already added. To find the remaining capacity, we need to subtract 120 from 40. The remaining capacity is 40 - 120 = -80. However, since we can't have a negative number of books, this means the bookshelf is already full. But if we want to find the total number of books the bookshelf can hold, we just need to multiply the number of shelves by the number of books each shelf can hold. The bookshelf can hold 5 x 8 = 40 books in total. Answer is ###{40}."

A loaf of white bread normally costs $2.00, but it's on sale for 20% off. If a customer buys 2 loaves of whole wheat bread and 3 loaves of white bread, how much will they pay in total?",
        "answer": "The whole wheat bread is on sale for 15% off, so the discount is 2.50 x 0.15 = $0.375 per loaf. The sale price is 2.50 - 0.375 = $2.125 per loaf. Since the customer buys 2 loaves, the total cost of the whole wheat bread is 2 x 2.125 = $4.25. The white bread is on sale for 20% off, so the discount is 2.00 x 0.20 = $0.40 per loaf. The sale price is 2.00 - 0.40 = $1.60 per loaf. Since the customer buys 3 loaves, the total cost of the white bread is 3 x 1.60 = $4.80.

        "answer": "Let's say the number of chocolate chip cookies sold is x. Then, the number of regular cookies sold is x + 30. The total number of cookies sold is the sum of the number of regular cookies and chocolate chip cookies. So, we can write the equation: x + (x + 30) = 480. Combining like terms, we get 2x + 30 = 480. Subtracting 30 from both sides, we get 2x = 450. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 225. This means 225 chocolate chip cookies were sold.

        "question": "A bakery sells a total of 480 boxes of cookies in a day. They sell a combination of chocolate chip and oatmeal raisin cookies. If the ratio of chocolate chip to oatmeal raisin cookies is 5:3, how many boxes of oatmeal raisin cookies did they sell?",
        "answer": "To find the total number of oatmeal raisin cookies, we need to first find the total parts in the ratio, which is 5 + 3 = 8. Then, we can find the number of boxes per part by dividing the total number of boxes by the total parts: 480 / 8 = 60. Since the oatmeal raisin cookies make up 3 parts of the ratio, we multiply the number of boxes per part by 3 to find the total number of oatmeal raisin cookies: 60 * 3 = 180. Answer is ###{180}."

        "answer": "To find the total amount of sugar needed, we need to multiply the amount of sugar per batch by the number of batches. 2 3/4 cups is equal to 11/4 cups. 11/4 * 4 = (11*4)/4 = 44/4 = 11 cups. To find the total amount of flour needed, we need to multiply the amount of flour per batch by the number of batches. 1 1/2 cups is equal to 3/2 cups. 3/2 * 4 = (3*4)/2 = 12/2 = 6 cups. So, the total amount of sugar needed is 11 cups and the total amount of flour needed is 6 cups. Answer is ###{11,6}."

        "answer": "To find the number of loaves of white bread sold, we need to find 2/5 of the total number of loaves sold. Since 3/5 of the bread is whole wheat, 2/5 of the bread is white. To find 2/5 of 480, we multiply 480 by 2 and divide by 5: (480 x 2) / 5 = 960 / 5 = 192. So, the bakery sells 192 loaves of white bread. Answer is ###{192}."

        "answer": "Let's say the number of sugar cookies sold is x. Then the number of oatmeal raisin cookies sold is x + 60. The total number of cookies sold is the sum of these two: x + (x + 60) = 480. Combine like terms: 2x + 60 = 480. Subtract 60 from both sides: 2x = 420. Divide both sides by 2: x = 210.

If they sell 60 more loaves of whole wheat bread than white bread, and they sell 1/4 of their total bread as whole wheat, how many loaves of white bread do they sell?",
        "answer": "Let's denote the number of white bread loaves as x. Since they sell 60 more loaves of whole wheat bread, the number of whole wheat loaves is x + 60. We know that 1/4 of their total bread is whole wheat, so the total number of whole wheat loaves is 1/4 * 480 = 120. Therefore, we can write the equation: x + (x + 60) = 120. Combining like terms, we get 2x + 60 = 120. Subtracting 60 from both sides, we get 2x = 60. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 30. So, the bakery sells 30 loaves of white bread. ###{30}"

The tank has 2400 - 1200 = 1200 liters left to fill. Since 3 liters are added every minute, it will take 1200 / 3 = 400 minutes to fill the tank. Answer is ###{400}."

        "answer": "Let's say they sell x loaves of white bread. Since they sell 3 times as many whole wheat loaves, they sell 3x loaves of whole wheat bread. We know that x + 3x = 480, because the total number of loaves sold is 480. Combining like terms, we get 4x = 480. Dividing both sides by 4, we get x = 120. Since x is the number of white bread loaves, they sell 120 loaves of white bread. Since they sell 3 times as many whole wheat loaves, they sell 3 x 120 = 360 loaves of whole wheat bread. Since they sell at least 40 whole wheat loaves, this is consistent with our calculation. So, the bakery sells 120 loaves of white bread and 360 loaves of whole wheat bread. The answer is ###{120,360}."

        "answer": "In the first week, 3 books are added to the bookshelf. In the second week, 2 books are added. In the third week, 1 book is added. So, the total number of books added is 3 + 2 + 1 = 6. Since each shelf can hold 8 books, we need to find the total number of shelves filled. We can do this by dividing the total number of books by 8. 6 books / 8 books per shelf = 0.75 shelves. Since we can't have a fraction of a shelf, we round down to 0 shelves. Therefore, the bookshelf will be filled with 6 books in 1 shelf and 0 books in the remaining 4 shelves. The remaining 4 shelves can be filled with 4 * 8 = 32 books. So, the total number of books on the bookshelf after 3 weeks is 6 + 32 = 38. Answer is ###{38}."

So, 5 shelves can hold 5 x 8 = 40 books. 40 - 48 = -8. Since the result is negative, it means the bookshelf is full. To find out how many books can still fit, we need to consider the next multiple of 8. 6 x 8 = 48. So, the bookshelf can hold 48 books, and since 48 books are already added, it is full.

Dividing both sides by 2 gives x = 200. Since x represents the number of boxes of cookies, the number of boxes of cupcakes is x + 80 = 200 + 80 = 280. Answer is ###{280}."

If the number of small boxes sold is 40 more than the number of large boxes sold, how many small and large boxes were sold?",
        "answer": "Let's say the number of large boxes sold is x. Then the number of small boxes sold is x + 40. The total number of cookies sold from large boxes is 18x and from small boxes is 12(x + 40). Since the total number of boxes sold is 480, we can write the equation 18x + 12(x + 40) = 480. Simplifying the equation, we get 30x + 480 = 480. Subtracting 480 from both sides, we get 30x = 0. Dividing both sides by 30, we get x = 0. So, the number of large boxes sold is 0.

        "answer": "Let's assume the number of whole wheat and rye bread is x. Since they sell the same number of whole wheat and rye, we have 2x + 5y + 3x = 250. Since the number of whole wheat and rye is the same, we can combine them as 5x. So the equation becomes 5x + 5y = 250. Since they sell the same number of whole wheat and rye, we can set y = x. So the equation becomes 5x + 5x = 250. Combining like terms, we get 10x = 250. Dividing both sides by 10, we get x = 25. Since y = x, the number of white bread is 5y = 5(25) = 125.

        "answer": "To find the total number of minutes, we need to calculate the total rate at which the pipes are filling the tank. 3 pipes are filling at 80 liters/minute, so that's 3 x 80 = 240 liters/minute. 2 pipes are filling at 60 liters/minute, so that's 2 x 60 = 120 liters/minute. 1 pipe is filling at 40 liters/minute. Adding these rates together, we get 240 + 120 + 40 = 400 liters/minute. To find the time to fill the tank, we need to divide the total capacity of the tank (2400 liters) by the rate at which the pipes are filling it (400 liters/minute). So, 2400 / 400 = 6 minutes.

        "answer": "Let's say the number of oatmeal raisin cookies is x. Since the number of chocolate chip cookies is 20 more than the number of oatmeal raisin cookies, the number of chocolate chip cookies is x + 20. The total number of chocolate chip and oatmeal raisin cookies is 30, so we can write the equation x + (x + 20) = 30. Combining like terms, we get 2x + 20 = 30.

        "answer": "Let's assume the number of whole wheat loaves sold is 3x and the number of white loaves sold is 5x. We know that 3x + 5x = 8x = 480. To find the value of x, we need to divide 480 by 8, which is 60. So, the number of whole wheat loaves sold is 3x = 3 x 60 = 180. Answer is ###{180}."

        "question": "A bakery sells a total of 480 loaves of bread per day. They sell a combination of whole wheat and white bread. If they sell 60 more loaves of whole wheat than white bread, how many loaves of white bread do they sell?",
        "answer": "Let's say the number of white bread loaves is x. Since they sell 60 more whole wheat loaves than white bread, the number of whole wheat loaves is x + 60. We know that the total number of loaves is 480, so we can set up the equation: x + (x + 60) = 480. Combining like terms, we get 2x + 60 = 480. Subtracting 60 from both sides, we get 2x = 420. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 210. So, the bakery sells 210 loaves of white bread. Answer is ###{210}."

        "question": "A bakery sells a total of 480 cupcakes in a day. They sell chocolate cupcakes and vanilla cupcakes in the ratio of 3:5. If they sell 120 chocolate cupcakes, how many vanilla cupcakes did they sell?",
        "answer": "The total ratio for the number of chocolate and vanilla cupcakes is 3+5 = <<3+5=8>>8\nFrom the ratios, the fraction representing the number of chocolate cupcakes is 3/8, and this represents 3/8*480 = <<3/8*480=180>>180 chocolate cupcakes.\nIf they sold 120 chocolate cupcakes, the number of chocolate cupcakes sold is 120.\nSince 3/8 of the cupcakes are chocolate, 5/8 of the cupcakes are vanilla. So, the number of vanilla cupcakes is 5/8*480 = 300.\nHowever, we are given that they sold 120 chocolate cupcakes, so we need to find the number of vanilla cupcakes sold. To find this, we can subtract the number of chocolate cupcakes sold from the total number of chocolate cupcakes: 180 - 120 = 60. Then, we can find the number of vanilla cupcakes sold by finding 5/8 of the remaining cupcakes: 5/8 * (480 - 180) = 5/8 * 300 = 187.5. Since we can't sell half a cupcake, this answer is incorrect. Instead, we can find the number of vanilla cupcakes sold by subtracting the number of chocolate cupcakes sold from the total number of cupcakes: 300 - 120 = 180. The correct answer is ###{180}."

        "answer": "To find the net rate at which the tank is being filled, we need to subtract the rate at which water is being drained from the rate at which it is being pumped in. The net rate is 120 - 80 = 40 liters per minute. To find the time it takes to fill the tank, we need to divide the total capacity of the tank by the net rate. 2400 / 40 = 60 minutes.

If they make a profit of $2 for every large box and a profit of $1 for every small box, and the total profit from selling large boxes is $120 more than the profit from selling small boxes, how many large boxes were sold?",
        "answer": "Let's say the number of large boxes sold is x and the number of small boxes sold is y. We know that x + y = 480 (total boxes sold) and 2x = y + 120 (profit difference). We can solve these equations by substituting y = 480 - x into the second equation. This gives us 2x = (480 - x) + 120. Simplifying this, we get 2x = 600 - x. Adding x to both sides gives us 3x = 600, and dividing both sides by 3 gives us x = 200. Therefore, the bakery sold 200 large boxes. Answer is ###{200}."

        "answer": "To find the initial amount of water leaked, we need to calculate 1/3 of 1200. 1/3 * 1200 = 400 liters. So, the remaining water in the tank is 1200 - 400 = 800 liters. Now, 1/4 of 800 is leaked, which is 1/4 * 800 = 200 liters. So, the remaining water is 800 - 200 = 600 liters.

        "answer": "To find the number of days it will take for the snail to reach the top, we need to calculate how much distance it covers each day. The snail climbs 3 feet up and slips 2 feet back, so it effectively covers 1 foot each day. Since the well is 20 feet deep, it will take the snail 20 / 1 = 20 days to reach the top. However, on the 20th day, it will climb the last 3 feet and reach the top, so it will actually take 19 days for the snail to climb 19 feet, and 1 more day to climb the last 3 feet. But since it slips back 2 feet each night, it will take 20 days for the snail to reach the top. But we need to consider the last 3 feet, so we can say it will take 20 days. Answer is ###{20}."

        "answer": "Let's denote the number of large boxes as x. We know that the total number of boxes sold is 480. Since there are 40 small boxes, the number of large boxes is 480 - 40 = 440. We also know that each large box contains 12 pastries. So, the total number of pastries from large boxes is 12x. The total number of pastries from small boxes is 8 x 40 = 320. The total number of pastries sold is 480. Therefore, 12x + 320 = 480. Solving for x, we get 12x = 160, x = 160/12 = 13.33 (round down to 13 since we can't sell a fraction of a box).

        "answer": "Let's assume the number of small boxes is x. Since the ratio of large boxes to small boxes is 5:3, the number of large boxes is (5/3)x. We also know that the number of large boxes is 120 more than the number of small boxes, so we can set up the equation (5/3)x = x + 120. Multiplying both sides by 3 to get rid of the fraction, we get 5x = 3x + 360. Subtracting 3x from both sides, we get 2x = 360. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 180. So, the number of small boxes is 180. The number of large boxes is (5/3) * 180 = 300. The bakery sells 180 boxes of small cookies and 300 boxes of large cookies. Answer is ###{180, 300}."

        "answer": "Let's say they sell x chocolate cupcakes. They sell 480 - x vanilla cupcakes. The total amount of money made from selling vanilla cupcakes is 2 * (480 - x) dollars. The total amount of money made from selling chocolate cupcakes is 2.5 * x dollars. The total amount of money made is 1200 dollars. So, we can write the equation: 2 * (480 - x) + 2.5 * x = 1200. Simplifying the equation, we get 960 - 2x + 2.5x = 1200. Combine like terms, we get 0.5x = 240. Divide both sides by 0.5, we get x = 480. So, they sell 480 chocolate cupcakes. To make 1500 dollars, they need to sell 480 - 480 = 0 chocolate cupcakes more, but that doesn't make sense, so let's re-evaluate the equation. We can also write the equation as 2.5x - 2(480 - x) = 300. Simplifying the equation, we get 2.5x - 960 + 2x = 300. Combine like terms, we get 4.5x - 960 = 300. Add 960 to both sides, we get 4.5x = 1260. Divide both sides by 4.5, we get x = 280. So, they sell 280 chocolate cupcakes. To make 1500 dollars, they need to sell 1500 - 1200 = 300 dollars more. Since each chocolate cupcake is 2.5 dollars, they need to sell 300 / 2.5 = 120 more chocolate cupcakes. Thus, they need to sell ###{120} more chocolate cupcakes."

        "answer": "First, we need to find the total number of large and small boxes. Let's assume the number of large boxes is 5x and the number of small boxes is 3x. Since the total number of boxes is 480, 5x + 3x = 480. So, 8x = 480 and x = 60. The number of large boxes is 5x = 5 x 60 = 300. The number of small boxes is 3x = 3 x 60 = 180. The large boxes contain 36 cookies each, so the total number of cookies in large boxes is 36 x 300 = 10800. Since the total number of cookies is 480 x 36 = 17280, the number of cookies in small boxes is 17280 - 10800 = 6480. Answer is ###{6480}."

        "answer": "To find the number of days it will take for the snail to reach the top of the well, we need to calculate the distance it covers each day. The snail climbs 3 feet up and slips 2 feet back, so it effectively covers 3 - 2 = 1 foot per day. To cover 20 feet, it will take the snail 20 / 1 = 20 days.

Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 210. So, the number of white bread loaves is 210 and the number of whole wheat loaves is 210 + 60 = 270. Since each white loaf costs $2, the total money made from white loaves is 210 x $2 = $420. Since each whole wheat loaf costs $4, the total money made from whole wheat loaves is 270 x $4 = $1080. The total money made from selling whole wheat and white loaves is $420 + $1080 = $1500. ###{1500}"

        "question": "A bakery sells a total of 480 cupcakes in a day. They sell vanilla cupcakes for $2 each and chocolate cupcakes for $3 each. If they made a total of $1,440 from the sale of the cupcakes, how many chocolate cupcakes did they sell?",
        "answer": "Let's say the number of vanilla cupcakes sold is V and the number of chocolate cupcakes sold is C. We know that V + C = 480 (total cupcakes) and 2V + 3C = 1440 (total revenue). We can solve this system of equations by multiplying the first equation by 2 to get 2V + 2C = 960. Subtracting this from the second equation gives us C = 480. Therefore, the bakery sold 480 - V = 480 - (480 - 480) = 480 chocolate cupcakes. Answer is ###{480}."

        "answer": "Let's say the number of small boxes sold is x. Then the number of large boxes sold is x + 60. The total number of cookies sold is 12x + 24(x + 60). We know that the total number of boxes sold is 480, so we can set up the equation x + (x + 60) = 480. Solving for x, we get 2x = 420, x = 210. Therefore, the number of small boxes sold is 210, and the number of large boxes sold is 270. The total number of cookies sold is 12(210) + 24(270) = 2520 + 6480 = 9000. Answer is ###{9000}."

        "answer": "To find the total amount of sugar needed, we multiply the amount of sugar per batch by the number of batches: 2 cups/batch * 5 batches = 10 cups. Since each bag of sugar contains 4 cups, they need 10 cups / 4 cups/bag = 2.5 bags of sugar. To find the total amount of flour needed, we multiply the amount of flour per batch by the number of batches: 3 cups/batch * 5 batches = 15 cups. Since each bag of flour contains 5 cups, they need 15 cups / 5 cups/bag = 3 bags of flour. Therefore, the bakery needs ###{2.5, 3} bags of sugar and flour respectively."

        "answer": "Let's say they sold x muffins and (480 - x) cakes. The total revenue is 2x + 3(480 - x) = 1440. Expanding the equation, we get 2x + 1440 - 3x = 1440. Simplifying the equation, we get -x = 0, which means x = 0. However, this can't be true as they sold some muffins. Let's try another approach. The total revenue is 2x + 3(480 - x) = 1440. We can simplify this to 2x + 1440 - 3x = 1440. Combine like terms to get -x + 1440 = 1440. Subtract 1440 from both sides to get -x = 0. Multiply both sides by -1 to get x = 0. However, this is not possible as they sold muffins. Let's try another approach. The total revenue is 2x + 3(480 - x) = 1440. We can simplify this to 2x + 1440 - 3x = 1440. Combine like terms to get -x + 1440 = 1440. Subtract 1440 from both sides to get -x = -1440. Multiply both sides by -1 to get x = 1440. So, they sold 1440 muffins. ###{1440}."

If they sell 60 more whole wheat loaves than white bread loaves, and let's say the number of white bread loaves is 'x', then how many whole wheat loaves do they sell?",
        "answer": "If the number of white bread loaves is 'x', then the number of whole wheat loaves is x + 60. Since the total number of loaves is 480, we can write an equation: x + (x + 60) = 480. Combining like terms, we get 2x + 60 = 480. Subtracting 60 from both sides, we get 2x = 420. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 210. So the number of white bread loaves is 210. The number of whole wheat loaves is x + 60 = 210 + 60 = 270. Answer is ###{270}."

        "answer": "Let's denote the number of white loaves as x. Since they sell 60 more whole wheat loaves than white loaves, the number of whole wheat loaves is x + 60. We know that the total number of loaves sold is 480, so we can set up the equation x + (x + 60) = 480. Simplifying this equation, we get 2x + 60 = 480.

We can solve the first equation for N: N = 480 - B. Substitute N into the second equation: 2.5B + 1.75(480 - B) = 1080. Expand and simplify: 2.5B + 840 - 1.75B = 1080. Combine like terms: 0.75B = 240. Divide by 0.75: B = 320. The bakery sold ###{320} blueberry muffins."

        "question": "A bakery sells a total of 480 loaves of bread per day. They sell a combination of whole wheat and white bread. If they sell 60 more whole wheat loaves than white loaves, and they sell 1/4 of their total loaves as whole wheat, how many loaves of white bread do they sell in a day?",
        "answer": "Let's denote the number of white bread loaves as x. Then the number of whole wheat loaves is x + 60. Since 1/4 of the total loaves are whole wheat, we can set up the equation: x + (x + 60) = 1/4 * 480. Simplifying the equation, we get 2x + 60 = 120. Subtracting 60 from both sides, we get 2x = 60. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 30. So, they sell 30 loaves of white bread in a day. ###{30}"

        "answer": "To find out how many boxes the bakery sells to the farmer's market, we need to find out how many boxes they sell to the grocery stores first. 1/4 of 250 is 250 x 1/4 = 62.5. 1/8 of 250 is 250 x 1/8 = 31.25. So, the total number of boxes sold to the grocery stores is 62.5 + 31.25 = 93.75. To find out how many boxes are left for the farmer's market, we need to subtract the total number of boxes sold to the grocery stores from the total number of boxes sold per day. 250 - 93.75 = 156.25.

        "answer": "First, we need to find the profit from the regular bread. The bakery sells 250 - 120 = 130 loaves of regular bread. The profit from regular bread is 130 x $0.50 = $<<130*0.5=65>>65. The loss from whole wheat bread is 120 x $0.25 = $<<120*0.25=30>>30. So, the total profit is $65 - $30 = $<<65-30=35>>35. ###{35}"

So, the total number of batches is 480 / 40 = 12. Since they make 3 batches in the morning and 2 in the afternoon, the total number of batches is 3 + 2 = 5.

We know that x + y = 480 (total loaves) and 2x + 1.5y = 720 (total revenue).\nTo solve this system of equations, we can multiply the first equation by 1.5 to get 1.5x + 1.5y = 720. Subtracting this from the second equation gives us 0.5x = 0, so x = 0.\nSince x = 0, we know that y = 480 (from the first equation). Therefore, the bakery sold 480 loaves of white bread.

        "answer": "Let's first find the number of whole wheat loaves. 2/5 of the total loaves are whole wheat, so the number of whole wheat loaves is 2/5 x 250 = 100 loaves.

        "answer": "To find the total number of days, we need to find the difference between the total height of the well and the height the snail slips back each night. The snail climbs 3 feet each day and slips back 2 feet at night, so it effectively climbs 3 - 2 = 1 foot each day.

        "answer": "Let's break this problem down step by step. 1/3 of the total bread is whole wheat, so 2/3 is white bread. Let's represent the number of white bread loaves as x. Since they sell 60 more whole wheat loaves, the number of whole wheat loaves can be represented as x + 60. We know that the total number of loaves is 480, so we can write the equation: x + (x + 60) = 480. Combining like terms, we get 2x + 60 = 480. Subtracting 60 from both sides, we get 2x = 420. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 210. Therefore, they sell 210 loaves of white bread. ###{210}"

        "answer": "First, we need to find the net rate at which the tank is being filled. The 3 pipes filling the tank are adding 3 x 80 = 240 gallons per minute. The 2 pipes draining the tank are removing 2 x 20 = 40 gallons per minute. So, the net rate is 240 - 40 = 200 gallons per minute. To find the time it will take to fill the tank, we divide the total capacity of the tank by the net rate: 1200 gallons / 200 gallons/minute = 6 minutes. Answer is ###{6}."

        "answer": "First, we find out how much water is filled on the first day: 3/5 of 1200 liters is 1200 * (3/5) = 720 liters. The remaining space is 1200 - 720 = 480 liters. On the second day, 1/4 of the remaining space is filled: 480 * (1/4) = 120 liters. So, the remaining space after the second day is 480 - 120 = 360 liters.

How much will you pay for a regular loaf and a whole wheat loaf during the sale?",
        "answer": "To find the sale price of the regular loaf, we need to calculate 15% of $2.50 and subtract it from the original price. 15% of $2.50 is 0.15 x $2.50 = $0.375. So, the sale price of the regular loaf is $2.50 - $0.375 = $2.125. To find the sale price of the whole wheat loaf, we need to calculate 20% of $3.25 and subtract it from the original price. 20% of $3.25 is 0.20 x $3.25 = $0.65. So, the sale price of the whole wheat loaf is $3.25 - $0.65 = $2.60. Therefore, the total amount you will pay for a regular loaf and a whole wheat loaf during the sale is $2.125 + $2.60 = $4.725.

        "answer": "Since they sell 3/5 of the bread as whole wheat, they must sell the rest as white bread, which is 1 - 3/5 = 2/5. To find 2/5 of 480, we can multiply 480 by 2/5. This is the same as multiplying 480 by 2 and then dividing by 5. 480 * 2 = 960. 960 / 5 = 192. So, the bakery sells 192 loaves of white bread. ###{192}"

        "answer": "Let's denote the number of white bread loaves as x. Since they sell 3/4 as many whole wheat loaves, the number of whole wheat loaves is (3/4)x. We are also given that they sell 60 more whole wheat loaves than white bread, so we can write the equation: (3/4)x = x + 60. Subtracting x from both sides, we get (1/4)x = 60.

        "question": "A bakery sells a total of 480 cupcakes in a day. They sell a combination of chocolate and vanilla cupcakes. If the ratio of chocolate to vanilla cupcakes is 3:5 and they sell 12 more chocolate cupcakes than vanilla cupcakes, how many chocolate cupcakes were sold?",
        "answer": "Let's break down the ratio of chocolate to vanilla cupcakes. The total parts in the ratio are 3 + 5 = 8. The number of chocolate cupcakes is 3/8 of the total cupcakes, and the number of vanilla cupcakes is 5/8 of the total cupcakes. Since they sell 12 more chocolate cupcakes than vanilla cupcakes, let's represent the number of vanilla cupcakes as x. Then, the number of chocolate cupcakes is x + 12. We can set up an equation: (3/8) * 480 = (x + 12). To solve for x, we need to first multiply 3/8 by 480, which is 180. Now we have 180 = x + 12. Subtract 12 from both sides to get x = 168. This means there were 168 vanilla cupcakes sold. To find the number of chocolate cupcakes, we add 12 to 168, which is 180. So, the bakery sold 180 chocolate cupcakes. Answer is ###{180}."

        "answer": "Let's start by finding the total number of whole wheat loaves. Since they sell 1/4 of the total loaves as whole wheat, they sell 1/4 x 480 = 120 whole wheat loaves. We are given that they sell 60 more whole wheat loaves than white bread loaves. Let's represent the number of white bread loaves as x. Then, the number of whole wheat loaves is x + 60. We know that the total number of whole wheat loaves is 120, so x + 60 = 120. Solving for x, we get x = 60. Therefore, they sell 60 loaves of white bread per day. Answer is ###{60}."

        "answer": "First, we need to find the total amount of flour needed for the cake, which is 2 3/4 + 1 1/2 = 4 1/4 cups. Since she already has 2 1/4 cups, we need to subtract the amount she has from the total amount needed. To do this, we need to convert the mixed numbers to improper fractions. 2 3/4 is equal to 11/4 and 1 1/2 is equal to 3/2. Now, we can find the least common multiple of 4 and 2, which is 4. Now, we can convert 3/2 to 6/4. Now we can subtract: (11/4) - (6/4) = (11-6)/4 = 5/4. To convert 5/4 to a mixed number, we divide the numerator by the denominator: 5 \u00f7 4 = 1 with a remainder of 1. So, the mixed number is 1 1/4. So she needs 1 1/4 more cups of flour. ###{1 1/4}"

        "answer": "Let's denote the number of white bread loaves as x. We know that the number of whole wheat loaves is 120 and it is 60 more than the number of white bread loaves, so the number of whole wheat loaves is x + 60. Since the total number of loaves is 480, we can set up the equation: x + (x + 60) = 480. Combine like terms: 2x + 60 = 480. Subtract 60 from both sides: 2x = 420. Divide both sides by 2: x = 210.

        "answer": "Let's represent the number of whole wheat loaves as x+30, since they sell 30 more whole wheat loaves than white bread loaves. We can set up the equation x + (x+30) = 480, since the total number of loaves sold is 480. Combining like terms, we get 2x + 30 = 480. Subtracting 30 from each side, we get 2x = 450. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 225. Since x represents the number of white bread loaves, and we know that x+30 represents the number of whole wheat loaves, then the number of whole wheat loaves is 225 + 30 = 255. Answer is ###{255}."

        "answer": "Let's start by finding the number of whole wheat loaves. 1/4 of 480 is 480 x 1/4 = <<480*1/4=120>>120 whole wheat loaves. Since they sell 60 more whole wheat loaves than white bread, the number of white bread loaves is 120 - 60 = 60. To check, 120 + 60 = 180, which is equal to 1/4 of 480.

        "answer": "To find the number of days it will take for the snail to reach the top, we need to find the difference between the total distance it climbs and the total distance it slips. On the first day, it climbs 3 feet and slips 2 feet, so it effectively climbs 3 - 2 = 1 foot. On the second day, it climbs 3 feet and slips 2 feet, effectively climbing 3 - 2 = 1 foot again. This pattern continues until it reaches the top of the well. To find the number of days it will take, we can divide the total distance by the effective climb per day. Since the snail climbs 1 foot per day, it will take 20 / 1 = 20 days to climb the first 20 feet. However, this is not the correct answer because the snail will slip back 2 feet each night, so we need to add 1 day for the snail to climb the last 2 feet. Therefore, the total number of days it will take for the snail to reach the top is 20 + 1 = 21. Answer is ###{21}."

        "answer": "First, we need to find the rate at which the 3 hoses fill the pool. 3 hoses filling at 60 gallons per minute each will fill at a rate of 3 x 60 = 180 gallons per minute. After 20 minutes, 2 hoses are turned off, so only 1 hose is left. The 1 hose will fill at a rate of 60 gallons per minute. To find out how much water has been filled in the first 20 minutes, we multiply 180 gallons per minute by 20 minutes: 180 x 20 = 3600 gallons. The pool can hold 2400 gallons, so we need to subtract the water already filled from the total capacity: 2400 - 3600 = -1200 gallons. This is incorrect, so we need to recalculate the time it takes to fill the pool with 3 hoses. 3 hoses will fill 2400 gallons in 2400 / 180 = 13.33 minutes. Since 2 hoses were turned off after 20 minutes, we need to find the amount of water filled by the 2 hoses in that time: 2 x 60 = 120 gallons per minute. Multiply this by 20 minutes: 120 x 20 = 2400 gallons. Since we've already filled the pool, the remaining 1 hose is not needed. The pool was filled in 20 minutes. Since the pool was filled in 20 minutes, the answer is ###{20}."

        "answer": "To find the number of loaves of white bread, we need to find 40% of the total bread sold. 40% of 480 is 0.4 x 480 = 192. So, the bakery sells 192 loaves of white bread per day. The answer is ###{192}."

        "question": "A bakery sells a total of 480 muffins and cakes in a day. The number of muffins sold is 3/5 of the total number of muffins and cakes. How many cakes were sold?",
        "answer": "Let's denote the number of muffins as M and the number of cakes as C. We know that M + C = 480. We also know that M = 3/5 * (M + C). To solve this equation, we can substitute M with 3/5 * (M + C) in the first equation: 3/5 * (M + C) + C = 480. Simplifying this equation, we get 3/5 * M + C + C = 480, which is equivalent to 3/5 * M + 2C = 480. We can multiply both sides by 5 to eliminate the fraction: 3M + 10C = 2400. Now we have two equations: M + C = 480 and 3M + 10C = 2400. We can solve this system of equations by multiplying the first equation by 3: 3M + 3C = 1440. Now subtracting this equation from 3M + 10C = 2400, we get 7C = 960. Dividing both sides by 7, we get C = 960 / 7 = 137.14 (rounded to two decimal places). Since we cannot sell a fraction of a cake, we round down to the nearest whole number. The number of cakes sold is ###{137}."

        "answer": "Let's denote the number of white bread loaves as W and the number of whole wheat loaves as WW. We know that WW = W + 60 and WW + W = 480. We can substitute WW with W + 60 in the second equation: W + 60 + W = 480. Combine like terms: 2W + 60 = 480. Subtract 60 from both sides: 2W = 420. Divide both sides by 2: W = 210.

The number of sugar cookies sold is 30 more than the number of chocolate chip cookies. If the number of chocolate chip cookies sold is 3 times the number of sugar cookies sold, what is the number of sugar cookies sold?",
        "answer": "Let's denote the number of sugar cookies as S and the number of chocolate chip cookies as C. We know that S + C = 480 and C = 3S + 30. Substituting the second equation into the first equation, we get S + 3S + 30 = 480. Combining like terms, we get 4S + 30 = 480. Subtracting 30 from both sides, we get 4S = 450.

To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator, which is 20. So, 3/5 is equal to 12/20 and 1/4 is equal to 5/20. Therefore, the total fraction of the tank filled is 12/20 + 5/20 = 17/20. Answer is ###{17/20}."

        "answer": "To find the number of hours it will take to fill the tank, we first need to find out how much water is still needed to fill the tank. Since 3/4 of the tank is already filled, the remaining 1/4 is 2400 * (1/4) = <<2400*(1/4)=600>>600 liters. To find out how many hours it will take to fill the remaining 600 liters, we divide the remaining amount by the hourly rate of 120 liters. So, 600 / 120 = <<600/120=5>>5 hours.

The length of the larger rectangle is 15 meters + 2 meters + 2 meters = 19 meters. The width of the larger rectangle is 8 meters + 2 meters + 2 meters = 12 meters. So, the area of the larger rectangle is 19 meters x 12 meters = 228 square meters. The area of the garden is 15 meters x 8 meters = 120 square meters.

        "answer": "The bakery sells 60% of 480 loaves as whole wheat bread. To find the number of whole wheat loaves, we multiply 480 by 60/100. 480 x 60/100 = 288 whole wheat loaves. Since the rest is white bread, we subtract the number of whole wheat loaves from the total. 480 - 288 = 192 white bread loaves. Therefore, the bakery sells 192 loaves of white bread per day. ###{192}"

If the ratio of whole wheat to white bread is 5:3 and they sell a total of 80 more whole wheat loaves than white bread loaves, how many whole wheat loaves did they sell?",
        "answer": "Let's say the number of white bread loaves is x. Then the number of whole wheat loaves is x + 80. The ratio of whole wheat to white bread is 5:3, so we can write the equation (x + 80) / x = 5 / 3. Cross-multiplying gives us 3(x + 80) = 5x. Expanding the equation gives us 3x + 240 = 5x. Subtracting 3x from both sides gives us 240 = 2x. Dividing both sides by 2 gives us x = 120. So the number of white bread loaves is 120 and the number of whole wheat loaves is 120 + 80 = 200.

        "answer": "Let's represent the number of white bread loaves as W. Since they sell 60 more whole wheat loaves, the number of whole wheat loaves is W + 60. The total number of loaves sold is the sum of white and whole wheat loaves: W + (W + 60) = 480. Combine like terms: 2W + 60 = 480. Subtract 60 from both sides: 2W = 420.

        "answer": "To find the total profit, we need to calculate the profit from whole wheat bread and white bread separately. They sell 480 loaves of whole wheat bread, so their profit from whole wheat bread is 480 x $0.50 = $240. They sell 480 loaves of white bread, so their profit from white bread is 480 x $0.25 = $120.

        "answer": "First, let's find the number of whole wheat breads sold in terms of the white breads. If they sell 30% more whole wheat than white bread, then the number of whole wheat breads is 120 + 30% of 120. To find 30% of 120, we multiply 120 by 0.3: 120 * 0.3 = 36. So, the number of whole wheat breads is 120 + 36 = 156. Then, to find the total number of loaves of bread, we add the number of whole wheat breads and the number of white breads: 156 + 120 = 276. However, we know that they sell 480 loaves of bread in total, so we need to find the number of white breads in terms of the total. Let's denote the number of white breads as x. Then the number of whole wheat breads is x + 30% of x. We know that x + (x + 0.3x) = 480. Combining like terms, we get 1.3x = 480. To solve for x, we divide both sides by 1.3: x = 480 / 1.3 = 369.23. Since we can't sell a fraction of a loaf of bread, we round down to 369. So, they sell 369 loaves of white bread and 156 loaves of whole wheat bread. However, we are asked to find the number of whole wheat breads. So, the answer is ###{156}."

If they sell 3 times as many small boxes as large boxes, and each large box contains 24 cookies, how many cookies are in the small boxes if each small box contains 16 cookies?",
        "answer": "Let's say the number of large boxes is x. Then the number of small boxes is 3x. Since the total number of boxes is 480, we have x + 3x = 480. This simplifies to 4x = 480, so x = 480/4 = 120. This means there are 120 large boxes and 3x = 3 x 120 = 360 small boxes. Since each large box contains 24 cookies, the total number of cookies in the large boxes is 120 x 24 = 2880. The total number of cookies in the small boxes is 360 x 16 = 5760. So, the small boxes contain 5760 cookies. Answer is ###{5760}."

The amount of money the third friend gets is x + 2x + 120 = 3x + 120. The sum of their amounts is 2x + 3x + (3x + 120) = 8x + 120. Since the total amount of money is $480, we can set up the equation 8x + 120 = 480. Solving for x, we get 8x = 360 and x = 45. So, the second friend gets $45, the first friend gets $165, and the third friend gets $3x + 120 = 3(45) + 120 = 135 + 120 = 255. The third friend gets $###{255}."

The student scored 72 marks in the first test and 85 marks in the second test. So, the total marks scored by the student is 72 + 85 = <<72+85=157>>157. The average score of the two tests is 80, so we can set up the equation (72 + 85) / 2 = 80 and solve for the total marks. Since (72 + 85) / 2 = 80, then 72 + 85 = 80 * 2 = 160.

        "answer": "To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the regular loaves and the whole wheat loaf separately and then add them together. The regular loaves are on sale for 15% off, so the discount is 15% of $2.50, which is 0.15 x $2.50 = $0.375. So, the cost of 2 regular loaves on sale is 2 x ($2.50 - $0.375) = 2 x $2.125 = $4.25.

The 2 pipes are filling the tank at a rate of 2 x 60 = 120 liters/minute. Adding this to the rate of the 3 pipes, we get 240 + 120 = 360 liters/minute. The total rate at which all the pipes are filling the tank is 360 + 120 = 480 liters/minute.

        "answer": "First, let's find out how many small boxes were sold. Since 1/4 of the total boxes were small, we can calculate this by multiplying the total number of boxes by 1/4: 480 * 1/4 = 120. Now, we know that the remaining 3/4 of the boxes were large. So, we can calculate the number of large boxes by subtracting the number of small boxes from the total: 480 - 120 = 360. However, this is the number of large boxes plus the remaining 3/4 of the boxes. To find the actual number of large boxes, we can multiply the number of remaining boxes by 1. So, 360 * 1 = 360. But we know that this is 3/4 of the total boxes, so we can set up a proportion: 3/4 = 360/x. We can then solve for x by cross-multiplying: 3x = 360 * 4. This gives us 3x = 1440. Dividing both sides by 3, we get x = 480. However, we know that this is the total number of boxes, so we need to find the number of large boxes. We already know that 1/4 of the total boxes were small, so 3/4 of the total boxes are large. We can calculate the number of large boxes by multiplying the total number of boxes by 3/4: 480 * 3/4 = 360. However, we also know that the total number of boxes minus the number of small boxes gives us the number of large boxes. So, 480 - 120 = 360. Therefore, the bakery sold 360 large boxes.

        "answer": "First, we need to find the discount amount. 15% of $2.50 is 0.15 x 2.50 = $0.375. So, the discount is $0.375 per loaf. To find the sale price, we subtract the discount from the original price: 2.50 - 0.375 = 2.125. Therefore, the sale price is $2.125 per loaf. For 4 loaves, you will pay 2.125 x 4 = $8.50. ###{8.50}"

The sale price for 1 loaf of bread will be $12 - $1.80 = $10.20. Since you are buying 5 loaves of bread, the total cost will be 5 x $10.20 = $51.00.

        "answer": "First, we need to find out how much water is already in the tank. Since 3/4 of the tank is filled, we need to multiply 2400 by 3/4. 2400 x 3/4 = 1800 liters. This means 1800 liters are already in the tank. To find out how much more water is needed, we subtract 1800 from 2400. 2400 - 1800 = 600 liters. Since water is being pumped in at a rate of 20 liters per minute, we can find the time it takes to fill the tank by dividing the remaining water needed by the rate. 600 / 20 = 30 minutes.

Since there are already 48 books on the bookshelf, we need to subtract 48 from the total capacity to find the remaining space. So, 40 - 48 = -8. However, since we can't have a negative number of books, we need to find the total capacity of the bookshelf and then subtract the number of books already on it. The total capacity is 5 x 8 = 40 books. Since there are 48 books on the bookshelf, we can only add 40 - 48 = -8 more books.

So, the sale price for a whole wheat loaf is $3.25 - $0.65 = $2.60. Now, we can find the total cost by multiplying the number of loaves by their sale prices: 2 x $2.125 = $4.25 for the regular loaves and 1 x $2.60 = $2.60 for the whole wheat loaf.

        "answer": "Let's start by finding the number of white bread loaves. Since they sell 3/5 of the total bread as white bread, we can calculate this as 3/5 x 480 = 288.\nThis means they sell 480 - 288 = 192 loaves of whole wheat bread.\nSince they sell 60 more whole wheat loaves than white bread loaves, we can set up the equation: 192 = 288 + 60.\nWe know this is true, so we can conclude that the number of white bread loaves is 288.

        "answer": "First, we need to find the sale price of each type of bread. The regular loaf is on sale for 15% off, so we need to calculate 15% of $2.50. 15% of $2.50 is 0.15 x 2.50 = $0.375. To find the sale price, we subtract this amount from the original price: $2.50 - $0.375 = $2.125. The whole wheat loaf is on sale for 20% off, so we need to calculate 20% of $3.25. 20% of $3.25 is 0.20 x 3.25 = $0.65. To find the sale price, we subtract this amount from the original price: $3.25 - $0.65 = $2.60. Now, we can find the total cost by adding the cost of the 2 regular loaves and the whole wheat loaf: 2 x $2.125 = $4.25, and $4.25 + $2.60 = $6.85. Sarah will pay a total of $6.85. ###{6.85}"

        "answer": "First, we need to find out how many loaves of bread are sold with a discount. Since they have a 25% discount for bulk orders of 24 loaves or more, we can divide the total number of loaves by 24 to get the number of bulk orders. 480 / 24 = 20. So, 20 bulk orders are sold with a discount. The remaining loaves are sold without a discount. 480 - (20 x 24) = 16 loaves are sold without a discount. Now, let's calculate the revenue from the bulk orders. 20 x 24 = 480 loaves are sold with a discount. Since they are sold at 25% discount, the price of each loaf is $2 x 0.75 = $1.5. So, the revenue from the bulk orders is 480 x $1.5 = $720. Now, let's calculate the revenue from the remaining loaves. 16 loaves are sold without a discount, so the revenue is 16 x $2 = $32. The total revenue is $720 + $32 = $752. The bakery's rent is $480. So, the profit is $752 - $480 = $272. Answer is ###{272}."

        "answer": "First, we need to find the profit from the sale of whole wheat bread. They sell 240 loaves of whole wheat bread per day at $2 each, so the revenue from whole wheat bread is 240 x 2 = $480. The profit from whole wheat bread is 25% of $480, which is 0.25 x 480 = $120. Next, we need to find the profit from the sale of white bread. They sell 240 loaves of white bread per day at $1.50 each, so the revenue from white bread is 240 x 1.50 = $360. The profit from white bread is 15% of $360, which is 0.15 x 360 = $54. The total profit is $120 + $54 = $174. The bakery makes ###{174} in a day."

        "answer": "First, let's calculate the discount on each type of bread. The discount on a regular loaf is 15% of $2.50, which is 0.15 x $2.50 = $0.375. So, the sale price of a regular loaf is $2.50 - $0.375 = $2.125. The discount on a whole wheat loaf is 20% of $3.25, which is 0.20 x $3.25 = $0.65. So, the sale price of a whole wheat loaf is $3.25 - $0.65 = $2.60. Now, let's calculate the total cost of the bread. 2 regular loaves at the sale price are 2 x $2.125 = $4.25. 1 whole wheat loaf at the sale price is $2.60. The total cost of the bread is $4.25 + $2.60 = $6.85. The original cost of the bread would have been 2 x $2.50 + $3.25 = $8.25. So, the total savings is $8.25 - $6.85 = $1.40. ###{1.40}"

Since they sell 60 more chocolate cupcakes, the number of chocolate cupcakes is x + 60. The total number of cupcakes is the sum of vanilla and chocolate cupcakes, which is x + (x + 60) = 480. Combining like terms, we get 2x + 60 = 480. Subtracting 60 from both sides, we get 2x = 420. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 210. So, the bakery sold 210 vanilla cupcakes.

        "answer": "To find the profit from whole wheat bread, we need to find 20% of the number of whole wheat bread sold. Since we don't know the number of whole wheat bread sold, we'll represent it as x. Then, the profit from whole wheat bread is 0.20 * 2 * x. We also don't know the number of white bread sold, so we'll represent it as y. The profit from white bread is 0.15 * 1.50 * y. The total profit is the sum of the profit from whole wheat bread and white bread. We know the total number of bread sold is 480, so x + y = 480. The total profit is 0.20 * 2 * x + 0.15 * 1.50 * y. We can rewrite this as 0.40x + 0.225y. Since x + y = 480, we can substitute y = 480 - x into the equation for total profit: 0.40x + 0.225(480 - x). Simplifying this, we get 0.40x + 108 - 0.225x.

        "answer": "Let's denote the number of boxes of chocolate chip cookies as x and the number of boxes of oatmeal raisin cookies as y. We can set up an equation: x + y = 480. Since chocolate chip cookies are sold in boxes of 24, the total number of chocolate chip cookies sold is 24x. Similarly, the total number of oatmeal raisin cookies sold is 30y. To find the number of boxes of each type of cookie, we can use the fact that the total number of cookies is a multiple of both 24 and 30. The least common multiple of 24 and 30 is 120. Therefore, we can write 480 = 2 * 240 = 4 * 120. This means that 240 boxes of cookies are sold in boxes of 24, and 240 boxes are sold in boxes of 30. So, x = 240 / 24 = 10 and y = 240 / 30 = 8.

        "question": "A bakery is having a sale on bread. A loaf of whole wheat bread normally costs $2.50 and a loaf of white bread normally costs $2.00. During the sale, the price of whole wheat bread is discounted by 15% and the price of white bread is discounted by 20%. How much will you save by buying 2 loaves of whole wheat bread and 1 loaf of white bread during the sale?",
        "answer": "The original price of 2 whole wheat breads is 2 x $2.50 = $<<2*2.5=5.00>>5.00 and the original price of 1 white bread is 1 x $2.00 = $<<1*2=2.00>>2.00.\nDuring the sale, the price of whole wheat bread is discounted by 15%, so the new price is 85% of the original price, which is 0.85 x $2.50 = $<<0.85*2.5=2.125>>2.13 per loaf. The price of white bread is discounted by 20%, so the new price is 80% of the original price, which is 0.80 x $2.00 = $<<0.80*2=1.60>>1.60 per loaf.\nSo, the total amount paid for 2 whole wheat breads and 1 white bread is 2 x $2.13 + 1 x $1.60 = $<<2*2.13+1*1.6=6.36>>6.36.\nThe total amount saved is the original price minus the sale price, which is $5.00 + $2.00 - $6.36 = $<<5+2-6.36=-0.36>>-0.36. Since you can't save a negative amount, the correct answer is that you won't save anything. The answer is ###{0}."

        "answer": "To find the net rate at which the tank is being filled, we need to subtract the rate at which the tank is being drained from the rate at which it is being filled. 3 people filling at 12 liters per minute each is 3 x 12 = 36 liters per minute. 2 people draining at 5 liters per minute each is 2 x 5 = 10 liters per minute. So, the net rate is 36 - 10 = 26 liters per minute. To find the time it will take to fill the tank, we divide the total capacity by the net rate. 2400 / 26 = 92.31 minutes.

        "answer": "Let's say the number of white bread loaves is x. Then the number of whole wheat loaves is x + 30. We know that the total number of loaves is 240, so x + (x + 30) = 240. Combining like terms, we get 2x + 30 = 240. Subtracting 30 from both sides, we get 2x = 210. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 105. So, the number of white bread loaves is 105 and the number of whole wheat loaves is 105 + 30 = 135. Each whole wheat loaf costs $2 more than each white bread loaf, so the difference in cost per loaf is $2. The total difference in cost is $2 x 135 = $270.

        "answer": "First, we need to find the amount of money they make per day at the old price. 250 loaves of bread at $2 per loaf is 250 * 2 = $<<250*2=500>>500. Then, we need to find the new price after the 15% increase. 2 + (2 * 0.15) = 2 + 0.30 = $<<2+2*0.15=2.30>>2.30. Now, we need to find the amount of money they make per day at the new price. 250 loaves of bread at $2.30 per loaf is 250 * 2.30 = $<<250*2.30=575>>575. To find the difference, we need to subtract the old price from the new price: 575 - 500 = $<<575-500=75>>75. So, they make $75 more per day. Answer is ###{75}. "

        "answer": "Let's denote the number of large boxes as x. Since the number of small boxes is 3 times the number of large boxes, the number of small boxes is 3x. We know that the total number of boxes sold is 480, so we can write the equation x + 3x = 480. Combining like terms, we get 4x = 480. Dividing both sides by 4, we get x = 120.

Simplifying the equation, we get 2x + 720 - 1.5x = 840, which becomes 0.5x = 120. Solving for x, we get x = 240. So, they sold 240 whole wheat breads. The money made from whole wheat bread is 240 x 2 = $<<240*2=480>>480. ###{480}"

        "answer": "Let's denote the number of cakes sold as x. Since the number of muffins sold is 120 more than the number of cakes, the number of muffins sold is x + 120. The total number of muffins and cakes sold is 480. So, we can write the equation x + (x + 120) = 480. Simplifying this equation, we get 2x + 120 = 480. Subtracting 120 from both sides, we get 2x = 360. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 180. Therefore, the number of muffins sold is x + 120 = 180 + 120 = 300. ###{300}"

        "answer": "To find the total amount of money made, we need to find the number of muffins and cakes sold first. Let's denote the number of muffins as M and the number of cakes as C. We know that M + C = 480. We also know that M = (3/5) * (M + C). Substituting M + C = 480, we get M = (3/5) * 480 = 288. So, the number of muffins sold is 288. The number of cakes sold is 480 - 288 = 192. The total amount of money made from muffins is 288 * $1.50 = $432. The total amount of money made from cakes is 192 * $2.50 = $480.

        "answer": "To find the time it takes to fill the tank, we need to find the net rate at which water is flowing into the tank. The net rate is the rate at which water is flowing in minus the rate at which water is leaking out. So, the net rate is 100 - 50 = 50 liters per minute. To find the time, we need to divide the total capacity of the tank by the net rate. So, time = 2400 / 50 = 48 minutes. Answer is ###{48}."

However, since we can't have a fraction of a shelf, we take the integer part of the result. Therefore, 15 shelves will be completely filled. The remaining books will be 120 - 15 * 8 = 0, which means all the books will be placed on the 15 shelves. The remaining books will not be enough to fill another shelf. So, the answer is ###{15}."

        "answer": "Let's denote the number of white bread loaves as W and the number of whole wheat loaves as WW. We know that W + WW = 480 and WW = W + 60. We can substitute WW in the first equation with W + 60 to get W + (W + 60) = 480. This simplifies to 2W + 60 = 480. Subtracting 60 from both sides gives 2W = 420. Dividing both sides by 2 gives W = 210. Now we know that WW = W + 60, so WW = 210 + 60 = 270. Thus, they sell 270 whole wheat loaves. Answer is ###{270}."

        "answer": "To find the total cost, we need to calculate the discount for each type of bread. The regular loaf is 15% off, so the discount is $2.50 x 0.15 = $0.375. The new price for the regular loaf is $2.50 - $0.375 = $2.125. The whole wheat loaf is 20% off, so the discount is $3.25 x 0.20 = $0.65. The new price for the whole wheat loaf is $3.25 - $0.65 = $2.60. The total cost is 2 x $2.125 + $2.60 = $5.45 + $2.60 = $7.05. Answer is ###{7.05}."

If they sell 60 more boxes of chocolate chip cookies than oatmeal raisin cookies, and they sell x boxes of oatmeal raisin cookies, then how many boxes of chocolate chip cookies do they sell?",
        "answer": "Let's say the number of oatmeal raisin cookies is x. Then, the number of chocolate chip cookies is x + 60. We know that the total number of cookies is 480. So, we can write the equation: x + (x + 60) = 480. Combining like terms, we get 2x + 60 = 480. Subtracting 60 from both sides, we get 2x = 420. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 210. So, the number of oatmeal raisin cookies is 210. Since they sell 60 more chocolate chip cookies, the number of chocolate chip cookies is 210 + 60 = 270. Therefore, the bakery sells 270 boxes of chocolate chip cookies. Answer is ####{270}."

        "answer": "The snail climbs 3 feet up during the day and slips 2 feet back at night, so it effectively climbs 1 foot per day. To find the number of days it takes to climb 20 feet, we need to divide 20 by 1, which is 20. However, the snail will not be able to climb the last 2 feet on the 20th day because it will slip back 2 feet that night.

        "answer": "Let's say they sell x boxes of regular cookies and (480 - x) boxes of chocolate chip cookies. Since they made a total of 960 dollars, we can set up the equation 5x + 7(480 - x) = 960. Simplifying the equation, we get 5x + 3360 - 7x = 960, which becomes -2x = -2400.

If they sell 60 more whole wheat loaves than white bread loaves, and they sell 1/4 of their bread as whole wheat, how many loaves of white bread do they sell per day?",
        "answer": "Let's say the number of white bread loaves sold is x. Then, the number of whole wheat loaves sold is x + 60. Since 1/4 of the total bread is whole wheat, we can set up the equation: (x + 60) = (1/4) * 480. To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 4: 4x + 240 = 480.

        "answer": "Let's assume the number of white bread loaves is x. Then, the number of whole wheat loaves is x + 120. We know that the total number of loaves is 480. Since 1/4 of the total loaves are whole wheat, 3/4 are white. So, we can write the equation: x + (x + 120) = 480. Combining like terms, we get 2x + 120 = 480.

        "answer": "To find the time it takes to fill the tank, we need to subtract the current amount of water from the total capacity of the tank. 2400 - 1500 = 900 liters are needed to fill the tank. Since 120 liters are added every hour, we can find the number of hours by dividing the remaining amount by the hourly rate. 900 / 120 = 7.5 hours. So, it will take 7.5 hours to fill the tank. Answer is ###{7.5}."

        "answer": "To find out how much sugar she needs in total, we first need to find out how much sugar she needs for 4 cakes. Since each cake requires 2/3 cup of sugar, 4 cakes will require 4 x 2/3 = 8/3 cups of sugar. She already has 3/4 cup of sugar. To find out how much more sugar she needs, we need to subtract the amount she already has from the amount she needs: 8/3 - 3/4 = (8 - 9) / 3 = -1/3. However, since we can't have a negative amount of sugar, we need to convert the fraction to a decimal. -1/3 is equal to -0.33. Since we can't have a negative amount of sugar, we need to find out how much sugar is needed in total for 4 cakes. 8/3 is equal to 2.67. So, the baker needs 2.67 - 0.75 = 1.92 cups of sugar in total. Answer is ###{1.92}."

        "answer": "Since the number of white bread loaves is 80, and they sold 60 more whole wheat loaves, we can find the number of whole wheat loaves by adding 60 to the number of white bread loaves: 80 + 60 = 140. Therefore, the bakery sold 140 whole wheat loaves. Answer is ###{140}."

        "answer": "To find the number of oatmeal raisin cookies, we need to find the total number of parts in the ratio, which is 5 + 3 = 8. We can then divide the total number of boxes by this total to find the value of one part, which is 480 / 8 = 60. Since the oatmeal raisin cookies make up 3 parts, we multiply 60 by 3 to get the number of oatmeal raisin cookies sold, which is 60 * 3 = 180. So, the bakery sold ###{180} boxes of oatmeal raisin cookies."

The bakery sells 250 loaves at $2 per loaf, so they make 250 x $2 = $<<250*2=500>>500 from the large loaves. They sell 120 loaves at $1.50 per loaf, so they make 120 x $1.50 = $<<120*1.5=180>>180 from the small loaves. The total amount of money is $500 + $180 = $<<500+180=680>>680.

        "answer": "Let's denote the number of white loaves as x. Then, the number of whole wheat loaves is 2x. We know that x + 2x = 480, so 3x = 480. Solving for x, we get x = 160. So, the number of white loaves is 160 and the number of whole wheat loaves is 2x = 320. The total amount of money made from white loaves is 160 x $2.00 = $320. The total amount of money made from whole wheat loaves is 320 x $2.50 = $800. Therefore, the total amount of money made is $320 + $800 = $1120. Answer is ###{1120}."

        "answer": "Let's denote the number of white bread loaves as x. We know that they sell 15 more whole wheat loaves than white bread, so the number of whole wheat loaves is x + 15. We are also given that they sell 60 whole wheat loaves. Therefore, x + 15 = 60. To find the value of x, we subtract 15 from both sides: x = 60 - 15 = <<60-15=45>>45. Therefore, they sell 45 white bread loaves. Since they sell a total of 240 loaves, the total number of whole wheat loaves and white bread loaves is 60 + 45 = <<60+45=105>>105. The number of white bread loaves is 240 - 105 = 135. The answer is ###{45}."

        "answer": "Let's denote the number of white bread loaves as x. Since they sell 60 more whole wheat loaves than white bread, the number of whole wheat loaves is x + 60. We know that 1/4 of the total bread is whole wheat, so we can set up the equation: (x + 60) / 2 = 1/4 * 480. To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 4: 4(x + 60) = 480. Expanding the equation, we get 4x + 240 = 480. Subtracting 240 from both sides, we get 4x = 240. Dividing both sides by 4, we get x = 60. So, the bakery sells 60 loaves of white bread per day.

        "answer": "First, let's find out how much water is already in the tank. 3/8 of 2400 is (3/8) x 2400 = 900 liters. To find the remaining capacity, we subtract 900 from 2400: 2400 - 900 = 1500 liters. Now, we need to find out how many hours it will take to fill the remaining 1500 liters. We can do this by dividing the remaining capacity by the rate at which water is being added: 1500 / 120 = 12.5 hours. It will take 12.5 hours to fill the tank. Answer is ###{12.5}."

        "answer": "Let's break this down step by step. First, let's find the number of whole wheat loaves. 1/4 of the total bread is whole wheat, so whole wheat loaves = 1/4 x 480 = 120 loaves. Since they sell 60 more whole wheat loaves than white bread loaves, we can set up the equation: whole wheat loaves = white bread loaves + 60. We know the whole wheat loaves are 120, so 120 = white bread loaves + 60. To find the number of white bread loaves, we subtract 60 from both sides: white bread loaves = 120 - 60 = 60. So, the bakery sells ###{60} loaves of white bread."

So, the 15 shelves will be filled in a circular manner, with the remaining books being placed on the 5 shelves. To find the number of shelves that will be completely filled, we need to divide 120 by 5. 120 \u00f7 5 = 24, but since we can't fill a fraction of a shelf, we round down to 24. However, since 24 is greater than the number of shelves, we need to find the remainder when 120 is divided by 5. 120 \u00f7 5 = 24 remainder 0.

        "answer": "Let's first find the number of whole wheat breads and white breads sold. Let x be the number of whole wheat breads and y be the number of white breads. We know that x + y = 480. We also know that the profit from whole wheat breads is 25% of $2x and the profit from white breads is 15% of $1.5y. To find the total profit, we need to calculate 0.25 * 2x + 0.15 * 1.5y. However, we don't have enough information to find the exact value of total profit. But we can express the total profit as a function of x: 0.5x + 0.225y. Since x + y = 480, we can express y as 480 - x. Substituting this value of y, we get 0.5x + 0.225(480 - x) = 0.5x + 108 - 0.225x = 0.275x + 108.

        "answer": "To find the number of loaves sold in the afternoon, we need to subtract the number of loaves sold in the morning from the total number of loaves. Since 3/5 of the bread is sold in the morning, the remaining 2/5 is sold in the afternoon. 2/5 of 480 is 2/5 x 480 = (2 x 480)/5 = 960/5 = 192.

        "answer": "Let's denote the number of white bread loaves as W. Since they sell 60 more whole wheat loaves than white bread loaves, the number of whole wheat loaves is W + 60. The total number of loaves is W + (W + 60). We know that 3/5 of the total is whole wheat, so we can set up the equation: 3/5(W + W + 60) = 480. To solve for W, we first simplify the equation: 3/5(2W + 60) = 480. Multiply both sides by 5 to get: 3(2W + 60) = 2400. Distribute the 3: 6W + 180 = 2400. Subtract 180 from both sides: 6W = 2220.

        "question": "A bakery sells a total of 480 loaves of bread in a day. They sell a combination of whole wheat and white bread. If they sold 60 more whole wheat loaves than white bread loaves, and each whole wheat loaf is $2 more than a white loaf, how much more money did they make from selling whole wheat bread compared to white bread?",
        "answer": "Let's assume the number of white bread loaves is x. Then, the number of whole wheat loaves is x + 60. The total number of loaves is 480, so we can write an equation: x + (x + 60) = 480. Simplifying this, we get 2x + 60 = 480. Subtracting 60 from both sides, we get 2x = 420. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 210. So, the number of white bread loaves is 210 and the number of whole wheat loaves is 210 + 60 = 270. The price of a white loaf is x and the price of a whole wheat loaf is x + 2. The total revenue from white bread is 210x and the total revenue from whole wheat bread is 270(x + 2). We want to find the difference in revenue, so we can write an expression: 270(x + 2) - 210x. Expanding this, we get 270x + 540 - 210x. Combining like terms, we get 60x + 540. We don't know the price of a loaf, but we can express the difference in revenue as a multiple of the price of a loaf: 60x + 540 = 60(x) + 540. This is equal to 60 times the price of a loaf plus 540. Since we don't know the price of a loaf, we can't simplify further. But we can write the answer in terms of the price of a loaf: ###{60x + 540}."

        "answer": "To find the amount of water the tank can still hold, we need to first find out how much water is already in the tank. 3/4 of 2400 liters is 2400 * 3/4 = 1800 liters. So, the tank already has 1800 liters of water. If 1200 liters are added to it, the total amount of water in the tank becomes 1800 + 1200 = 3000 liters. The tank can hold 2400 liters, so it can still hold 2400 - 3000 = -600 liters. However, since the tank can't hold a negative amount of water, we need to find the absolute value. The absolute value of -600 is 600. Therefore, the tank can still hold ###{600} liters of water."

        "question": "A bakery sells a total of 480 loaves of bread per day. They sell a combination of whole wheat and white bread. If they sell 60 more loaves of whole wheat bread than white bread, and they sell 3 times as many loaves of white bread as they do whole wheat bread, how many loaves of white bread do they sell per day?",
        "answer": "Let's start by using the information that they sell 3 times as many loaves of white bread as whole wheat bread. Let's call the number of whole wheat bread 'x', then the number of white bread is 3x. We know they sell 60 more loaves of whole wheat than white bread, so we can write an equation: x = 3x + 60. Subtracting 3x from both sides, we get -2x = 60. Dividing both sides by -2, we get x = -30. However, since we can't sell a negative number of loaves, this is not a valid solution. Let's re-examine the problem. If they sell 3 times as many loaves of white bread as whole wheat bread, and x is the number of whole wheat bread, then the number of white bread is 3x. We know they sell 60 more loaves of whole wheat than white bread, so we can write an equation: x = 3x - 60. Subtracting 3x from both sides, we get -2x = -60. Dividing both sides by -2, we get x = 30. So the number of white bread is 3x = 3(30) = 90. The answer is ###{90}."

If the number of chocolate chip cookies sold is 120 more than the number of oatmeal raisin cookies, how many boxes of oatmeal raisin cookies were sold?",
        "answer": "Let's represent the number of oatmeal raisin cookies as x. Then the number of chocolate chip cookies is x + 120. Since the total number of cookies sold is 480, we can set up the equation: x + (x + 120) = 480. Combine like terms: 2x + 120 = 480. Subtract 120 from both sides: 2x = 360. Divide by 2: x = 180. So, the bakery sold 180 boxes of oatmeal raisin cookies. The total number of chocolate chip cookies sold is 180 + 120 = 300. The total number of cookies sold is 180 + 300 = 480. Answer is ###{180}."

        "answer": "Let's assume the number of whole wheat loaves sold in the morning is 5x and the number of white bread loaves sold in the morning is 3x. Since the ratio of whole wheat to white bread is 5:3, the total number of loaves sold in the morning is 5x + 3x = 8x. Since they sell the same number of loaves in the morning and afternoon, the total number of loaves sold in the day is 2 * 8x = 16x. We are given that the total number of loaves sold per day is 480, so 16x = 480. Solving for x, we get x = 480 / 16 = 30. The number of whole wheat loaves sold in the morning is 5x = 5 * 30 = 150.

        "answer": "First, we find the amount of water in the tank after the first hour. 3/5 of 2400 liters is (3/5) x 2400 = 1440 liters. So, the tank is filled with 1440 liters after the first hour. In the second hour, 1/4 of the remaining capacity is filled. The remaining capacity is 2400 - 1440 = 960 liters. 1/4 of 960 liters is (1/4) x 960 = 240 liters. So, the tank is filled with 1440 + 240 = 1680 liters after two hours. Answer is ###{1680}."

Since we can't have a negative number of books, we can add 40 + 120 = 160 to the total number of books already added to find the new total. Therefore, the bookshelf was initially full and the new total is 160. Since the bookshelf can hold 40, the number of books that can still be added is 40 - 160 = -120.

A large box contains 24 cookies and a small box contains 12 cookies. If the number of large boxes sold is 3 times the number of small boxes sold, how many small boxes were sold?",
        "answer": "Let S be the number of small boxes sold. The number of large boxes sold is 3S. The total number of cookies from the large boxes is 24 x 3S = 72S. The total number of cookies from the small boxes is 12 x S = 12S. The total number of cookies sold is 480. So, 72S + 12S = 480. Combining like terms, 84S = 480. Dividing both sides by 84, S = 480 / 84 = 5.75. Since you can't sell a fraction of a box, we round down to the nearest whole number. So, the bakery sold 5 small boxes. To find the total number of large boxes sold, we multiply the number of small boxes sold by 3: 5 x 3 = 15. In total, they sold 5 small boxes + 15 large boxes = 20 boxes. Answer is ###{20}."

We know the total number of bread is 480, so 8x = 480. To find x, we divide both sides by 8, which gives us x = 480 / 8 = 60.

If the number of chocolate chip cookies is 40 more than the oatmeal raisin cookies, and the ratio of oatmeal raisin to chocolate chip is 2:5, calculate the number of oatmeal raisin cookies sold.",
        "answer": "Let's assume the number of oatmeal raisin cookies is 2x and the number of chocolate chip cookies is 5x. We know that 2x + 5x = 480, so 7x = 480. To find the value of x, we divide both sides by 7: x = 480 / 7 = 68.48 (round down to 68 since we can't sell a fraction of a cookie). The number of oatmeal raisin cookies is 2x = 2 * 68 = 136. The answer is ###{136}."

        "answer": "To find the number of days it takes for the snail to reach the top, we need to calculate the net distance it covers each day. The snail climbs 3 feet up and slips 2 feet back, so the net distance covered each day is 3 - 2 = 1 foot. Since the well is 20 feet deep, the snail will need 20 / 1 = 20 days to reach the top. However, on the 20th day, the snail will climb 3 feet and won't slip back, so it will reach the top on the 20th day. Answer is ###{20}."

If the number of small boxes is 40 more than the number of large boxes, how many large boxes were sold?",
        "answer": "Let's denote the number of large boxes as L and the number of small boxes as S. We are given that S = L + 40. We also know that the total number of boxes is 480, so L + S = 480. Substituting S = L + 40 into this equation, we get L + (L + 40) = 480, which simplifies to 2L + 40 = 480. Subtracting 40 from both sides, we get 2L = 440. Dividing both sides by 2, we get L = 220.

So, the number of small boxes is 480 - L. Since the number of small boxes is 1/3 of the total, we can write the equation: (480 - L) = (1/3)(480 + L). We can simplify this equation to solve for L. First, multiply both sides by 3 to get rid of the fraction: 3(480 - L) = 1(480 + L). This simplifies to 1440 - 3L = 480 + L. Next, add 3L to both sides to get 1440 = 480 + 4L.

        "answer": "Let's assume the number of chocolate chip cookies is 5x and the number of oatmeal raisin cookies is 3x. Since the total number of cookies is 480, 5x + 3x = 480. Combining like terms, we get 8x = 480. Dividing both sides by 8, we get x = 60. So the number of oatmeal raisin cookies is 3x = 3 x 60 = 180. Therefore, the bakery sold ###{180} boxes of oatmeal raisin cookies."

        "answer": "First, we need to find the total amount of sugar and flour needed for 4 batches of cookies. 2 cups of sugar are needed per batch, so 2 x 4 = 8 cups of sugar are needed in total. 1 cup of flour is needed per batch, so 1 x 4 = 4 cups of flour are needed in total. They already have 6 cups of sugar, so they have enough sugar. They already have 5 cups of flour, but they need 4 cups of flour, so they need to buy 4 - 5 = -1 cups of flour. However, we cannot have a negative amount of flour, so they actually need to buy 1 cup of flour. Answer is ###{1}."

        "question": "A bakery sells a total of 480 loaves of bread in a day. They sell a combination of whole wheat and white bread. If they sold 60 more whole wheat loaves than white bread loaves, and each whole wheat loaf costs $2 more than each white bread loaf, how much more money did they make from selling whole wheat bread than white bread?",
        "answer": "Let's say the number of white bread loaves sold is x. Then the number of whole wheat loaves sold is x + 60. We know that x + (x + 60) = 480. Combining like terms, we get 2x + 60 = 480. Subtracting 60 from both sides, we get 2x = 420. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 210. So, they sold 210 white bread loaves and 210 + 60 = 270 whole wheat loaves. Each whole wheat loaf costs $2 more than each white bread loaf, so the difference in cost per loaf is $2. The total amount made from whole wheat bread is 270 x ($2 + cost of one white bread loaf). Let's call the cost of one white bread loaf 'w'. Then, the total amount made from whole wheat bread is 270 * (w + 2). The total amount made from white bread is 210w. The difference in the amount made from whole wheat and white bread is 270 * (w + 2) - 210w. Factoring out w, we get 270w + 540 - 210w = 60w + 540. The problem doesn't give us the cost of one white bread loaf, so we can't give a numerical answer. However, we can say that the difference is 60w + 540. But since the question asks for a numerical answer, we'll assume the cost of one white bread loaf is $1. Then, the difference is 60 * 1 + 540 = 60 + 540 = 600. ###{600}."

        "answer": "To find out how many hours it will take to fill the tank, we need to find out how much water is left to fill the tank. Since 3/4 of the tank is already filled, that means 1/4 of the tank is still empty. To find 1/4 of 1200, we can multiply 1200 by 1/4, which is the same as dividing by 4. 1200 \u00f7 4 = 300.

Since 3/4 of the tank is filled, we can calculate it by multiplying the total capacity by 3/4. 2400 x 3/4 = 1800 liters. The remaining capacity is 2400 - 1800 = 600 liters. To find out how many hours it will take to fill the remaining capacity, we divide the remaining capacity by the rate at which water is added per hour. 600 / 120 = 5 hours.

        "answer": "To find the total number of boxes of 18 cookies, we need to find 2/3 of the total number of cookies. 2/3 of 480 is 320. So, the bakery packs 320/18 = 17.78 boxes of 18 cookies, but we can't have a fraction of a box, so they pack 17 boxes of 18 cookies. The remaining cookies are 480 - 320 = 160. These are packed into boxes of 24 cookies, so 160/24 = 6.67 boxes of 24 cookies, but again we can't have a fraction of a box, so they pack 6 boxes of 24 cookies. Answer is ###{17, 6}."

        "answer": "The total parts in the ratio are 5 + 3 = 8. The fraction of the total bread that is whole wheat is 5/8. To find the fraction of the total bread that is white, we subtract the fraction of whole wheat from 1, which is 1 - 5/8 = 3/8. Since they sell a total of 480 loaves, we multiply the fraction of white bread by the total to find the number of loaves of white bread: 480 * 3/8 = 180.

        "answer": "To find the total profit, we need to find the profit from whole wheat bread and white bread separately. Let's assume they sell x whole wheat loaves and y white bread loaves. We know that x + y = 480. We also know that the total revenue from whole wheat bread is 2x and from white bread is 1.5y. We don't know the exact values of x and y, but we can express the total profit in terms of x and y. The profit from whole wheat bread is 0.25 * 2x = 0.5x and the profit from white bread is 0.15 * 1.5y = 0.225y. The total profit is 0.5x + 0.225y. We can substitute y = 480 - x into the equation to get 0.5x + 0.225(480 - x) = 0.5x + 108 - 0.225x = 0.275x + 108. Now we need to find the value of x. We know that x + y = 480, so x + (480 - x) = 480. The x's cancel out, and we get 480 = 480. This is a true statement, which means that x can be any value. However, we can find the maximum profit by substituting x = 480 into the equation for total profit: 0.275(480) + 108 = 132 + 108 = 240. The answer is ###{240}."

        "answer": "First, let's find the discount for each type of bread. The discount for a regular loaf is 15% of $2.50, which is 0.15 * 2.50 = $0.375. The discount for a whole wheat loaf is 15% of $3.25, which is 0.15 * 3.25 = $0.4875. Now, let's calculate the price of each type of bread after the discount. The price of a regular loaf after the discount is $2.50 - $0.375 = $2.125. The price of a whole wheat loaf after the discount is $3.25 - $0.4875 = $2.7625. The total cost of 2 regular loaves and 1 whole wheat loaf is 2 * $2.125 + $2.7625 = $5.25 + $2.7625 = $8.0125. Therefore, the customer will pay $8.01. ###{8.01}"

        "answer": "To find the number of vanilla cupcakes sold, we need to subtract the total amount made from the sales of chocolate cupcakes from the total amount made. Let's first find the number of chocolate cupcakes sold. 3x + 2y = 1440 and 3x + 2(480 - x) = 1440. 3x + 960 - 2x = 1440. x = 240. 3x = 720. 2y = 720. y = 360.

        "answer": "Let's denote the number of white bread loaves as x. Then, the number of whole wheat loaves is x + 60. Since they sell 1/4 of their total bread as whole wheat, we can set up the equation: (x + 60) / (x + (x + 60)) = 1/4. Multiplying both sides by 4(x + (x + 60)), we get 4x + 240 = x + 60.

Since the number of loaves can't be negative, this means our initial assumption that the bakery sells 1/4 of their bread as whole wheat is incorrect. Let's try again.

        "answer": "To find the total cost, we need to calculate the discount on each type of bread and then add them up. The regular loaf is on sale for 15% off, so the discount is $2.50 x 15% = $2.50 x 0.15 = $0.375. The sale price of the regular loaf is $2.50 - $0.375 = $2.125. The whole wheat loaf is on sale for 20% off, so the discount is $3.25 x 20% = $3.25 x 0.20 = $0.65. The sale price of the whole wheat loaf is $3.25 - $0.65 = $2.60.

        "answer": "Let the number of whole wheat bread be 5x and the number of white bread be 4x. The total number of bread is 5x + 4x = 9x. We know that 9x = 480. To find the value of x, we divide both sides by 9, which gives us x = 480 / 9 = 53.33. Since x is the multiplier for the number of white bread, we multiply x by 4 to get the number of white bread: 4x = 4 * 53.33 = 213.33. Since we can't sell a fraction of a loaf, we round down to the nearest whole number. So, the bakery sells approximately 213 loaves of white bread per day. Answer is ###{213}."

        "answer": "Let W be the number of whole wheat loaves and w be the number of white bread loaves. We know that W + w = 480 and W = w + 60. We can substitute W in the first equation with w + 60 to get w + 60 + w = 480. Combining like terms, we get 2w + 60 = 480. Subtracting 60 from both sides, we get 2w = 420. Dividing both sides by 2, we get w = 210. Since W = w + 60, we have W = 210 + 60 = 270. Therefore, they sell 270 whole wheat loaves. The answer is ###{270}."

The bookshelf has 5 shelves, and each shelf can hold 8 books. So, the total capacity of the bookshelf is 5 x 8 = 40 books. Since 48 books are added to the bookshelf, the number of empty spaces is 40 - 48 = -8. To find the percentage of the bookshelf that is still empty, we need to divide the number of empty spaces by the total capacity and multiply by 100.

        "question": "A bakery sells a total of 480 muffins and cakes in a day. They sold 3/8 of the muffins and 1/4 of the cakes. If the ratio of the price of a muffin to a cake is 2:3, and a muffin costs $2, how much money did the bakery make in total?",
        "answer": "Let's find out the number of muffins and cakes sold. 3/8 of 480 muffins is (3/8) x 480 = 180 muffins. 1/4 of 480 cakes is (1/4) x 480 = 120 cakes. The total number of items sold is 180 + 120 = 300. Since the ratio of muffins to cakes is 2:3, the total number of muffins is 2/5 of the total items, which is (2/5) x 300 = 120 muffins. The number of cakes is 3/5 of the total items, which is (3/5) x 300 = 180 cakes. Now, we can find the total money made. The money made from muffins is 120 x $2 = $240. The money made from cakes is 180 x ($2 x 3/2) = $270. So, the total money made is $240 + $270 = $510. Answer is ###{510}."

        "answer": "Let's denote the number of white bread loaves as W and the number of whole wheat loaves as WW. We know that WW = W + 60 and WW + W = 480. We can substitute WW with W + 60 in the second equation, resulting in (W + 60) + W = 480. This simplifies to 2W + 60 = 480. Subtracting 60 from both sides gives us 2W = 420. Dividing both sides by 2, we get W = 210. Now that we know W, we can find WW by substituting W into WW = W + 60, which gives us WW = 210 + 60 = 270. So, the bakery sells 270 whole wheat loaves.

        "answer": "Let's denote the number of white loaves as x. Then the number of whole wheat loaves is 2x. The total number of loaves sold is x + 2x = 3x. Since they sell 250 loaves per day, 3x = 250. Solving for x, we get x = 250 / 3 = 83.33. However, since the number of loaves must be a whole number, we'll round down to 83. The number of white loaves is 83, and the number of whole wheat loaves is 2 * 83 = 166. The profit from whole wheat loaves is 166 x $0.50 = $83. The profit from white loaves is 83 x $0.25 = $20.85.

        "answer": "To find the total amount spent on regular gas, we need to first find the total amount spent on premium and diesel gas. The premium gas costs $2.50 per gallon * 10 gallons = $<<2.50*10=25>>25. The diesel gas costs $2.80 per gallon * 5 gallons = $<<2.80*5=14>>14. So, the total amount spent on premium and diesel gas is $25 + $14 = $39. Now, we can find the amount spent on regular gas by subtracting the amount spent on premium and diesel gas from the total amount spent on gas. $85 total - $39 spent on premium and diesel = $<<85-39=46>>46. Since Maya bought 15 gallons of regular gas, we can find the amount spent on regular gas by multiplying the number of gallons by the cost per gallon. $46 / 15 gallons = $<<46/15=3.07>>3.07 per gallon.

        "answer": "To find the number of buses needed, we need to divide the total number of students by the capacity of each bus. 360 students require 360 / 48 = 7.5 buses. Since we can't have a fraction of a bus, we round up to the nearest whole number. So, 360 students require 8 buses. Now, we need to find the number of buses needed for 840 students. To do this, we can multiply the number of buses needed for 360 students by the ratio of 840 to 360. 840 / 360 = 2.33. So, the number of buses needed for 840 students is 8 * 2.33 = 18.64.

        "answer": "To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each type of bread after the discount. The regular loaf is on sale for 15% off, so the discount is 15% of $2.50, which is 0.15 x $2.50 = $0.375. The sale price of the regular loaf is $2.50 - $0.375 = $2.125. The whole wheat loaf is on sale for 20% off, so the discount is 20% of $3.25, which is 0.20 x $3.25 = $0.65. The sale price of the whole wheat loaf is $3.25 - $0.65 = $2.60. Since Sarah buys 2 regular loaves and 1 whole wheat loaf, the total cost is 2 x $2.125 + $2.60 = $5.25 + $2.60 = $7.85. The total amount Sarah will pay is ###{7.85}."

        "question": "A bakery is having a sale on bread. A regular loaf of bread normally costs $2.50, but it's on sale for 15% off. A whole wheat loaf normally costs $3.25, but it's on sale for 20% off. If Sarah buys 2 regular loaves and 1 whole wheat loaf, how much will she pay in total?",
        "answer": "First, let's find the discount on each type of bread. The discount on a regular loaf is 15% of $2.50, which is 0.15 x $2.50 = $<<0.15*2.5=0.375>>0.375. So, the sale price of a regular loaf is $2.50 - $0.375 = $2.125. The discount on a whole wheat loaf is 20% of $3.25, which is 0.20 x $3.25 = $0.65. So, the sale price of a whole wheat loaf is $3.25 - $0.65 = $2.60. Since Sarah buys 2 regular loaves and 1 whole wheat loaf, the total cost is 2 x $2.125 + $2.60 = $4.45 + $2.60 = $<<2*2.125+2.6=6.75>>6.75. The total amount Sarah will pay is ###{6.75}."

        "answer": "Let's say the number of white bread loaves sold is x. Then, the number of whole wheat loaves sold is x + 60. We know that the total number of loaves sold is 480, so we can set up the equation x + (x + 60) = 480. Combining like terms, we get 2x + 60 = 480. Subtracting 60 from both sides, we get 2x = 420. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 210. Therefore, they sold 210 loaves of white bread. ###{210}"

        "answer": "To find the total number of books the bookshelf can hold, we multiply the number of shelves by the number of books each shelf can hold. 5 shelves * 8 books/shelf = 40 books. Since the bookshelf already has 120 books, we need to subtract the number of books already on the bookshelf from the total capacity. 40 - 120 = -80. Since we can't have a negative number of books, the bookshelf is already full. However, we can rephrase the question to find the number of books that can be added: The bookshelf can hold 40 books in total, and it already has 120 books, so we need to subtract 120 from the total capacity: 40 - 120 = -80. Since we can't have a negative number of books, the bookshelf is already full.

        "answer": "Let's start with the 36-boxes. We know that the number of 36-boxes is 1/3 of the 18-boxes, so if we let x be the number of 18-boxes, then the number of 36-boxes is x/3. We also know that the total number of boxes is 480, so we can set up the equation: x/3 + x + 12x = 480.\nSimplifying the equation, we get 16x/3 = 480. Solving for x, we get x = 480 * 3 / 16 = 90.\nSo, the number of 18-boxes is 90, the number of 36-boxes is 90 / 3 = 30, and the number of 12-boxes is 480 - 90 - 30 = 360. Answer is ###{30, 90, 360}."

        "answer": "The snail climbs 3 feet up and slips back 2 feet down each day, so it effectively moves 1 foot up each day. To find the number of days it takes to reach the top, we need to subtract the distance it climbs from the total height of the well: 15 - 1 = 14 days to climb 14 feet, and 1 day to climb the last foot.

Since they sold 3/5 of the boxes in the morning, the remaining 2/5 were sold in the afternoon. To find the number of boxes sold in the afternoon, we need to calculate 2/5 of 480. 2/5 x 480 = (2 x 480) / 5 = 960 / 5 = 192. The number of boxes sold in the afternoon is ###{192}."

        "answer": "Let's use the ratio to set up an equation. Let x be the number of groups of 8 boxes. Then, the number of chocolate chip cookies is 5x and the number of oatmeal raisin cookies is 3x. Since the total number of cookies is 480, we can set up the equation 5x + 3x = 480. Combining like terms, we get 8x = 480. Dividing both sides by 8, we get x = 60. Since the number of oatmeal raisin cookies is 3x, the number of oatmeal raisin cookies sold is 3 x 60 = 180.

        "answer": "Let's assume the number of large boxes sold is 2x and the number of small boxes sold is 5x. Since the total number of boxes sold is 480, we can write an equation: 2x + 5x = 480. Combining like terms, we get 7x = 480. Dividing both sides by 7, we get x = 480 / 7 = 68.4. Since x represents the number of groups of boxes, we can find the number of large boxes by multiplying x by 2: 2x = 2 * 68.4 = 136.6. Since we can't sell a fraction of a box, we round down to the nearest whole number: 136. The number of small boxes is 5x = 5 * 68.4 = 342. So, the bakery sold 136 large boxes and 342 small boxes.

        "answer": "The regular loaf of bread is on sale for 15% off, so it will cost 2.50 - (2.50 x 0.15) = 2.50 - 0.375 = 2.125. The whole wheat loaf of bread is on sale for 20% off, so it will cost 3.25 - (3.25 x 0.20) = 3.25 - 0.65 = 2.60. To find the total cost, we add the cost of the 2 regular loaves and the whole wheat loaf: 2.125 x 2 = 4.25 and 4.25 + 2.60 = 6.85. Answer is ###{6.85}."

Then, they sell (480 - x) loaves of white bread. The total revenue from whole wheat bread is 2x and from white bread is 1.5(480 - x). The total revenue is 2x + 1.5(480 - x). The profit is the total revenue minus the cost of the bread. Since they make a profit of $0.75 per loaf, the cost per loaf is $2 - $0.75 = $1.25. The total cost is 1.25(480) = $600. The profit is 2x + 1.5(480 - x) - 600. To find the value of x, we need to set up an equation. Since they sell a total of 480 loaves, x + (480 - x) = 480. This simplifies to x = 240.

        "question": "A bakery is having a sale on bread. A regular loaf of bread normally costs $2.50, but it's on sale for 15% off. A whole wheat loaf normally costs $3.25, but it's on sale for 20% off. If Sarah buys 2 regular loaves and 1 whole wheat loaf, how much will she pay in total?",
        "answer": "First, find the discount on the regular loaf: $2.50 * 15% = $2.50 * 0.15 = $<<2.50*0.15=0.375>>0.375. Then subtract the discount from the regular price: $2.50 - $0.375 = $2.125. Next, find the discount on the whole wheat loaf: $3.25 * 20% = $3.25 * 0.20 = $0.65. Then subtract the discount from the whole wheat price: $3.25 - $0.65 = $2.60. Now, add the prices of the two loaves together: $2.125 + $2.60 = $4.725. Finally, multiply by the number of regular loaves: $4.725 * 2 = $9.45. Then add the price of the whole wheat loaf: $9.45 + $2.60 = $12.05. So, Sarah will pay $12.05. ###{12.05}"

        "answer": "To find the total number of loaves of bread sold in a month, we need to multiply the number of loaves sold per day by the number of days in a month. There are 7 days in a week, so in 4 weeks, the bakery operates 7 x 4 = 28 days. Therefore, the total number of loaves of bread sold in a month is 250 x 28 = 7000. Answer is ###{7000}."

        "answer": "The bakery packs 1/3 of 480 boxes in bags of 12 cookies each. 480 x 1/3 = 160 boxes. Each of these boxes contains 12 cookies, so the total number of cookies in these boxes is 160 x 12 = 1920. The bakery also packs 1/4 of 480 boxes in bags of 16 cookies each. 480 x 1/4 = 120 boxes. Each of these boxes contains 16 cookies, so the total number of cookies in these boxes is 120 x 16 = 1920. So, the total number of cookies packed is 1920 + 1920 = 3840. Since there are 480 boxes in total and 160 + 120 = 280 boxes are packed, the number of boxes left to be packed is 480 - 280 = 200. Each of these boxes contains 24 cookies, so the total number of cookies left to be packed is 200 x 24 = 4800. The answer is ###{4800}."

        "question": "A bakery sells a total of 480 loaves of bread per day. They sell a combination of whole wheat and white bread. If they sell 60 more whole wheat loaves than white bread loaves, and they sell a total of 200 white bread loaves, how many whole wheat loaves do they sell?",
        "answer": "To find the number of whole wheat loaves, we need to find the difference between the total number of loaves and the number of white bread loaves. The number of whole wheat loaves is 60 more than the number of white bread loaves. Let's represent the number of white bread loaves as x. Then the number of whole wheat loaves is x + 60. We know that the total number of loaves is 480, so x + (x + 60) = 480. Simplifying the equation, we get 2x + 60 = 480. Subtracting 60 from both sides, we get 2x = 420. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 210. Since the number of white bread loaves is 210, the number of whole wheat loaves is 210 + 60 = 270. Answer is ###{270}."

The sale price is $2.50 - $0.375 = $2.125 per loaf. To find the total price for 4 loaves, we multiply the sale price by 4: $2.125 x 4 = $8.50. Answer is ###{8.50}"

        "question": "A bakery is having a sale on bread. A regular loaf of bread normally costs $2.50, but it's on sale for 15% off. A whole wheat loaf of bread normally costs $3.25, but it's on sale for 20% off. How much will you pay for 2 regular loaves and 1 whole wheat loaf during the sale?",
        "answer": "First, we need to find the discount for each type of bread. The regular loaf has a 15% discount, so the discount is 2.50 x 0.15 = $0.375. The whole wheat loaf has a 20% discount, so the discount is 3.25 x 0.20 = $0.65. To find the sale price of the regular loaf, we subtract the discount from the original price: 2.50 - 0.375 = 2.125. To find the sale price of the whole wheat loaf, we subtract the discount from the original price: 3.25 - 0.65 = 2.60. Since we are buying 2 regular loaves, the total cost of the regular loaves is 2 x 2.125 = 4.25. Adding the cost of the whole wheat loaf, the total cost is 4.25 + 2.60 = 6.85.

        "answer": "To find the total amount of sugar and salt needed, we need to calculate the total amount needed for 3 batches. Each batch requires 1 cup of sugar and 1/4 cup of salt. So, for 3 batches, they will need 3 x 1 = 3 cups of sugar and 3 x 1/4 = 3/4 cup of salt. Since they already have 6 cups of flour, we don't need to consider it.

This means that 15 shelves will be completely filled, but since there are only 5 shelves, we need to find how many books will be left over. To find the number of books that will be left over, we can multiply the number of shelves that will be completely filled by the number of books each shelf can hold and subtract this from the total number of books. 15 shelves * 8 books/shelf = 120 books. Since this is equal to the total number of books, all 5 shelves will be completely filled. Answer is ###{5}."

        "answer": "Let's represent the total number of muffins and cupcakes as x. We know that muffins sold are 3/5 of x, so the number of muffins sold is (3/5)x. The number of cupcakes sold is the remaining 2/5 of x, which is (2/5)x. We know that the total number of muffins and cupcakes sold is 480, so we can write the equation (3/5)x + (2/5)x = 480. To solve for x, we can add (3/5)x and (2/5)x to get (5/5)x = 1x. So, the equation becomes x = 480. Since x represents the total number of muffins and cupcakes, we know that x = 480. The number of cupcakes sold is (2/5)x, which is (2/5)*480 = 192. Answer is ###{192}."

        "answer": "Let's break this down step by step. Let the number of vanilla cupcakes be V and the number of chocolate cupcakes be C. We are given that C = V + 30. We are also given that V = (1/4) * 480 + 60 = 120 + 60 = 180. Now that we know V, we can find C. C = V + 30 = 180 + 30 = 210. So, the bakery sold 210 chocolate cupcakes. ###{210}"

        "answer": "Since the ratio of whole wheat to white bread is 5:3, the total parts of the ratio is 5 + 3 = 8. To find the value of each part, we divide the total number of loaves by the total parts of the ratio: 480 / 8 = 60. Since white bread makes up 3 parts of the ratio, we multiply 3 by the value of each part: 3 x 60 = 180. So, the bakery sold 180 loaves of white bread. Answer is ###{180}."

        "answer": "Let's denote the number of white bread loaves as W and the number of whole wheat loaves as WW. We know that W + WW = 480 and WW = W + 60. We can substitute the second equation into the first one: W + (W + 60) = 480. This simplifies to 2W + 60 = 480. Subtracting 60 from both sides gives us 2W = 420. Dividing both sides by 2 gives us W = 210. Since WW = W + 60, we can substitute W = 210 to get WW = 210 + 60 = 270. The bakery sells 270 whole wheat loaves. Answer is ###{270}."

        "answer": "Let's first calculate the number of whole wheat and rye breads sold. Let x be the number of whole wheat breads and y be the number of rye breads. We have the equation x + y = 480. We also know that the total revenue from whole wheat bread is 2x and from rye bread is 1.5y. The profit from whole wheat bread is 0.25 * 2x = 0.5x and from rye bread is 0.15 * 1.5y = 0.225y. The total profit is 0.5x + 0.225y. We can express y as 480 - x and substitute it in the profit equation: 0.5x + 0.225(480 - x) = 0.5x + 108 - 0.225x = 108 - 0.225x. To find the value of x, we set the profit equation equal to the total profit: 108 - 0.225x = P. We know that the maximum profit is obtained when x = 480. So, we can substitute x = 480 in the profit equation: 108 - 0.225(480) = 108 - 108 = 0. So, the maximum profit is $0. However, this is not possible, so we try x = 400: 108 - 0.225(400) = 108 - 90 = 18. So, the profit is $18 when 400 whole wheat breads and 80 rye breads are sold. The total profit is 0.5 * 400 + 0.225 * 80 = 200 + 18 = $218. ###{218}"

        "answer": "Let's denote the total number of baked goods as x. We know that 40% of x is equal to the number of muffins sold. Since muffins and cakes together make up the total number of baked goods, the number of cakes is 60% of x. We can write the equation: 40% of x + 60% of x = 480. Combining like terms, we get 100% of x = 480. Solving for x, we get x = 480. Since the number of muffins is 40% of x, the number of muffins is 40% of 480 = 0.4 x 480 = 192. The number of cakes is 60% of x, so the number of cakes is 60% of 480 = 0.6 x 480 = 288. Therefore, the number of cakes sold is ###{288}."

        "answer": "Let's denote the number of white loaves as W and the number of whole wheat loaves as WW. We are given that W + WW = 480 and WW = W + 60. We can substitute WW in the first equation with W + 60 to get W + (W + 60) = 480. This simplifies to 2W + 60 = 480. Subtracting 60 from both sides gives 2W = 420. Dividing both sides by 2 gives W = 210. Now that we have the number of white loaves, we can find the number of whole wheat loaves by substituting W into WW = W + 60: WW = 210 + 60 = 270. So, the bakery sells 270 whole wheat loaves. Answer is ###{270}."

        "answer": "To find the number of boxes sold to the small caf\u00e9, we first need to find the number of boxes sold to the large restaurant. Since they sell 3/4 of the boxes to the large restaurant, we can multiply 480 by 3/4 to get the number of boxes sold to the large restaurant. 480 x 3/4 = 360 boxes. Since the bakery sells the rest to the small caf\u00e9, the number of boxes sold to the small caf\u00e9 is 480 - 360 = 120 boxes. Since the small caf\u00e9 buys the rest in boxes of 12, we need to divide 120 by 12 to find the number of boxes. 120 / 12 = 10. So, the small caf\u00e9 gets 10 boxes. ###{10}"

We know that w + wh = 480 and wh = 1.2w\nSubstituting the second equation into the first equation, we get w + 1.2w = 480\nCombining like terms, we get 2.2w = 480\nDividing both sides by 2.2, we get w = 218.18. Since we can't sell a fraction of a loaf of bread, we round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we will keep the answer as a decimal for accuracy. So, the bakery sells approximately ###{218.18} loaves of white bread."

        "answer": "The bakery sells 3/4 of the bread as whole wheat. To find the number of whole wheat loaves, we need to multiply 3/4 by 250. 3/4 x 250 = 187.5. The rest of the bread is white bread. Since they sell whole wheat and white bread in whole numbers, we'll round 187.5 to 187 whole wheat loaves. So, the number of white bread loaves is 250 - 187 = 63. Therefore, the bakery sells 63 loaves of white bread in a day. ###{63}"

        "answer": "The bakery sells 250 loaves of bread per day and has 10 loaves of unsold bread. So, they sell 250 - 10 = 240 loaves of bread. The profit from selling 240 loaves of bread is 240 x $0.25 = $60. The loss from the unsold bread is 10 x $0.05 = $0.50. The total profit is $60 - $0.50 = $59.50. Answer is ###{59.50}."

        "answer": "Let's say the number of chocolate chip cookies sold is x. Then, the number of oatmeal raisin cookies sold is 480 - x. The total amount made from chocolate chip cookies is 1.5x and the total amount made from oatmeal raisin cookies is 2.25(480 - x). We know that the total amount made is $810, so we can set up the equation 1.5x + 2.25(480 - x) = 810. To solve for x, we can first distribute 2.25 to 480 - x to get 1.5x + 1080 - 2.25x = 810. Then, we can combine like terms to get -0.75x + 1080 = 810. Next, we can subtract 1080 from both sides to get -0.75x = -270. Finally, we can divide both sides by -0.75 to get x = 360. Therefore, the bakery sold 360 chocolate chip cookies. ###{360}"

So, the first 15 shelves will be completely filled. However, we only have 5 shelves, so we need to find out how many books will be left over. 15 x 8 = 120, but we only have 5 shelves, so we need to find the remainder of 120 / 5. 120 % 5 = 0.

Therefore, x = 250 / 3 = 83.33 (round down to 83 since we can't sell a fraction of a loaf). So, they sell 83 white bread loaves and 2 * 83 = 166 whole wheat loaves. They earn $2 x 83 = $166 for white bread and $2.5 x 166 = $415 for whole wheat bread. In total, the bakery earns $166 + $415 = $581.50 per day. Answer is ###{581.50}."

We also know that the total number of cookies sold is 24L + 12S = 480 * 24 (since there are 24 cookies per box). Since the total number of boxes is 480, we can simplify the second equation to 24L + 12S = 11520. We can simplify this further by dividing both sides by 4 to get 6L + 3S = 2880. Now, we can solve for L by multiplying the first equation by 3 to get 3L + 3S = 1440, then subtracting it from 6L + 3S = 2880 to get 3L = 1440. Dividing both sides by 3 gives us L = 480.

        "answer": "To find the total number of books that the bookshelf can hold, we need to multiply the number of shelves by the number of books each shelf can hold. The bookshelf can hold 5 x 8 = 40 books. Since there are 120 books, we need to find out how many shelves will be used. We can do this by dividing 120 by 8 to find out how many books will be on each shelf, then divide that by 8 to find out how many shelves will be used. 120 / 8 = 15. Then 15 / 8 = 1.875. Since you can't have a fraction of a shelf, we round down to 1.875, which means 15 books will be on 2 shelves and the rest will be on the third shelf. So, 120 - 24 = 96 books will be on 12 shelves. Since the bookshelf has 5 shelves, the number of empty shelves is 5 - 12 = -7. Since you can't have a negative number of empty shelves, we need to find the number of shelves that can be used. We can do this by taking the absolute value of -7, which is 7. The number of empty shelves is 5 - 7 = -2. Since you can't have a negative number of empty shelves, we need to find the number of shelves that can be used. We can do this by taking the absolute value of -2, which is 2. The number of empty shelves is 5 - 2 = 3. Answer is ###{3}."

        "answer": "Let's denote the number of white bread loaves as W. Since they sell 60 more whole wheat loaves than white bread, the number of whole wheat loaves is W + 60. We know that 1/4 of the total bread is whole wheat, so the equation becomes: W + (W + 60) = 480 * 1/4. This simplifies to 2W + 60 = 120. Subtracting 60 from both sides, we get 2W = 60.

So, the total money made from rye bread is 1.5x. The total money made from whole wheat bread is $840 - 1.5x. We know that the total money made is $840, which is the sum of money made from rye bread and whole wheat bread. We also know that the total number of loaves sold is 480. Since rye bread is sold for $1.50, the number of rye bread sold is x. The number of whole wheat bread sold is 480 - x. The total money made from rye bread is 1.5x and the total money made from whole wheat bread is 2(480 - x). We know that 1.5x + 2(480 - x) = 840. Now, let's simplify the equation: 1.5x + 960 - 2x = 840. Now, let's solve for x: -0.5x = -120. Now, let's divide both sides by -0.5: x = 240.

        "answer": "To find the total number of loaves, we need to add the number of loaves sold on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. The number of loaves sold on Monday is 250. The number of loaves sold on Tuesday is 300. The number of loaves sold on Wednesday is 300 + 20% of 300 = 300 + 0.2 x 300 = 300 + 60 = 360. So, the total number of loaves is 250 + 300 + 360 = 910.

        "answer": "The bakery sold 250 loaves of bread on Monday and 300 loaves on Tuesday. To find the total number of loaves sold on these two days, we need to add them together. 250 + 300 = 550 loaves. To find the rate at which they sell bread, we divide the total number of loaves sold by the number of days: 550 / 2 = 275.5 loaves per day.

        "answer": "To find the total number of whole wheat loaves, we need to calculate 1/4 of the total loaves. 1/4 of 480 loaves is 480 x 1/4 = 120 loaves. Since they sell 60 more whole wheat loaves than white bread loaves, let's represent the number of white bread loaves as x. So, the number of whole wheat loaves is x + 60. Since we know that the total number of whole wheat loaves is 120, we can set up the equation: x + 60 = 120. Solving for x, we get x = 60. So, they sell 60 loaves of white bread in a day. Answer is ###{60}."

To find the price after the discount, we subtract the discount from the original price: $12 - $1.80 = $10.20.

        "answer": "Let's denote the number of white bread loaves as W. Since they sell 60 more whole wheat loaves than white bread loaves, the number of whole wheat loaves is W + 60. The total number of loaves is 480, and 1/4 of the total loaves are whole wheat, so 1/4 x 480 = 120 whole wheat loaves. Therefore, W + (W + 60) = 120. Combining like terms, 2W + 60 = 120.

The regular loaf is on sale for 15% off, so the discount is 2.50 x 0.15 = $0.375. The discounted price of the regular loaf is 2.50 - 0.375 = $2.125. The whole wheat loaf is on sale for 20% off, so the discount is 3.25 x 0.20 = $0.65. The discounted price of the whole wheat loaf is 3.25 - 0.65 = $2.60. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of each type of bread by its discounted price and add them together: 2 x 2.125 = 4.25 and 1 x 2.60 = 2.60. The total cost is 4.25 + 2.60 = 6.85.

Since 48 books are added to the bookshelf, the number of empty spaces is 40 - 48 = -8. However, since we can't have a negative number of empty spaces, we need to find the total capacity of the bookshelf and subtract the number of books that are actually on the bookshelf. The total capacity is 5 shelves * 8 books/shelf = 40 books. Since 48 books are on the bookshelf, the number of empty spaces is 40 - 48 = -8. However, this is not possible. Therefore, the bookshelf must be full, and the number of empty spaces is 0. To find the percentage of the bookshelf that is still empty, we need to divide the number of empty spaces by the total capacity and multiply by 100. 0 / 40 = 0. Therefore, the bookshelf is 0% empty.

Since they make a profit of $0.50 on each loaf of bread, the total profit is 250 x $0.50 = $<<250*0.5=125>>125. So, the profit they make in a day is $125 - $600 = $<<125-600=-475>>-475. However, this is incorrect since profit can't be negative. The bakery must be selling more than 250 loaves of bread to make a profit. The correct answer is that they make a profit of $0 on the bread. However, if they sell more than 250 loaves, the profit will be the difference between the revenue and the cost of ingredients. For example, if they sell 300 loaves, the profit will be (300 - 250) x $0.50 = $50. Since the problem doesn't specify the number of loaves sold, we can only conclude that the profit is $0 for 250 loaves. The correct answer is ###{0}."

        "answer": "First, let's find the discount for each type of bread. The regular loaf is 15% off, so the discount is $2.50 x 0.15 = $0.375. The whole wheat loaf is 20% off, so the discount is $3.25 x 0.20 = $0.65. The sale price for the regular loaves is $2.50 - $0.375 = $2.125 per loaf. The sale price for the whole wheat loaf is $3.25 - $0.65 = $2.60. The total cost of the regular loaves is 2 x $2.125 = $4.25. The total cost of the whole wheat loaf is 1 x $2.60 = $2.60. The total cost is $4.25 + $2.60 = $6.85. You will pay ###{6.85}."

        "answer": "To find the number of large boxes sold, we need to find out how many boxes were not small boxes. First, find out how many small boxes were sold: 480 boxes / 12 cookies/box = 40 small boxes. Then subtract the number of small boxes from the total number of boxes: 480 boxes - 40 boxes = 440 boxes. Since each large box has 24 cookies, we can find the number of large boxes by dividing the number of cookies in the large boxes by the number of cookies per box: 440 boxes * 24 cookies/box = 10560 cookies. Then divide the total number of cookies by the number of cookies in a large box: 10560 cookies / 24 cookies/box = 440 boxes. So, the bakery sold ###{440} large boxes."

        "answer": "To find the rate at which the tank is being filled, we need to subtract the draining rate from the filling rate. 3 people filling at 5 gallons per minute each is 3 x 5 = 15 gallons per minute. 2 people draining at 2 gallons per minute each is 2 x 2 = 4 gallons per minute. So, the net filling rate is 15 - 4 = 11 gallons per minute. To find the time it takes to fill the tank, we divide the total capacity of the tank by the net filling rate. 1200 / 11 = 109.09 minutes.

        "answer": "To find the total cost, we need to calculate the discount for each type of bread and then add them up. The regular loaves are 15% off, so the discount is 2.50 * 0.15 = 0.375 dollars off each loaf. The total discount for the 2 regular loaves is 0.375 * 2 = 0.75 dollars. The whole wheat loaf is 20% off, so the discount is 3.25 * 0.20 = 0.65 dollars. The total discount is 0.75 + 0.65 = 1.40 dollars. The total cost of the bread before the discount is 2.50 * 2 + 3.25 = 9.00 dollars. So, the total amount the customer will pay is 9.00 - 1.40 = 7.60 dollars. Answer is ###{7.60}."

        "answer": "Let's denote the number of chocolate cupcakes as x and the number of vanilla cupcakes as y. We know that x + y = 480 (total cupcakes) and 2x + 1.5y = 900 (total revenue). We can solve this system of equations to find the value of x. Multiplying the first equation by 1.5 gives 1.5x + 1.5y = 720. Subtracting this equation from the second equation gives 0.5x = 180. Dividing both sides by 0.5 gives x = 360. So, the bakery sold 360 chocolate cupcakes. The number of vanilla cupcakes is 480 - 360 = 120. Answer is ###{360}."

Since we cannot sell a fraction of a loaf, this is incorrect. However, we can try W = 112, which gives us WW = 112 + 15 = 127. Checking, 112 + 127 = 239, which is close to 240. Therefore, the bakery sells 127 whole wheat loaves and 112 white bread loaves. Answer is ###{127}."

        "answer": "Let's first find the total number of whole wheat loaves. 3/8 of 480 is 3/8 * 480 = 180. Since they sell 40 more loaves of whole wheat than white bread, we can let the number of white bread loaves be x. Then, the number of whole wheat loaves is x + 40. We know that x + (x + 40) = 480, since the total number of loaves sold is 480. Simplifying the equation, we get 2x + 40 = 480. Subtracting 40 from both sides, we get 2x = 440. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 220. Therefore, the number of loaves of white bread sold is 220. Answer is ###{220}."

        "answer": "Let's represent the number of regular cookies as 5x and the number of sugar-free cookies as 3x, where x is a positive integer. Since the total number of cookies is 480, we can write the equation 5x + 3x = 480. Combining like terms, we get 8x = 480. To find the value of x, we divide both sides by 8: x = 480 / 8 = 60. Now that we have the value of x, we can find the number of sugar-free cookies: 3x = 3 * 60 = 180. Therefore, the bakery sold 180 boxes of sugar-free cookies. ###{180}"

So, the bookshelf can hold 5 x 8 = 40 books. If 120 books are already added, then the remaining space is 40 - 120 = -80. However, since we can't have a negative number of books, we need to find the total capacity and subtract the number of books already added. The total capacity is 5 x 8 = 40. The remaining books that can be added is 40 - 120 = -80. Since we can't have a negative number of books, it means the bookshelf is full. The correct way to solve this is to first find out how many books are already on the bookshelf. 120 books are already on the bookshelf. The remaining space is 5 x 8 - 120 = 20.

Since we can't have a negative number of shelves, we will assume the 6 shelves are full and calculate how many books are left to be placed on the other shelves. 120 total books - 48 already placed = 72 books left. Since 6 shelves are already full, we only have 5 - 6 = -1 shelves left. However, we will assume the 6 shelves are full and calculate how many books can be placed on the other shelves.

The total amount of sugar needed is 2/3 * 5 = 10/3 cups. The total amount of butter needed is 1/4 * 5 = 5/4 cups. To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 12. So, the total amount of sugar needed is 10/3 * 4/4 = 40/12 cups. The total amount of butter needed is 5/4 * 3/3 = 15/12 cups. The least common multiple of 3 and 4 is 12, so the total amount of sugar and butter needed is 40/12 + 15/12 = 55/12 cups.

If they sell 60 more boxes of oatmeal raisin cookies than chocolate chip cookies, and they sell x boxes of chocolate chip cookies, then how many boxes of oatmeal raisin cookies did they sell?",
        "answer": "Let O be the number of boxes of oatmeal raisin cookies and C be the number of boxes of chocolate chip cookies. We are given that O = C + 60 and O + C = 480. Substituting the first equation into the second, we get C + 60 + C = 480. Combining like terms, we get 2C + 60 = 480. Subtracting 60 from both sides, we get 2C = 420. Dividing both sides by 2, we get C = 210. Since O = C + 60, we get O = 210 + 60 = 270. So, the bakery sold 270 boxes of oatmeal raisin cookies. ###{270}"

        "answer": "First, let's find the number of white bread loaves sold. Since each white bread is sold for $1.50 and the total amount made from white bread is unknown, we'll call it x. The total amount made from white bread is 1.5x. The total amount made from whole wheat bread is 2 times the number of whole wheat loaves, which is 2 * (480 - x). The total amount made from both types of bread is 1.5x + 2 * (480 - x) = 780. Simplifying the equation, we get 1.5x + 960 - 2x = 780. Combining like terms, we get -0.5x + 960 = 780. Subtracting 960 from both sides, we get -0.5x = -180. Dividing both sides by -0.5, we get x = 360. So, the number of white bread loaves sold is 360. The number of whole wheat bread loaves sold is 480 - 360 = 120. The amount made from whole wheat bread is 2 * 120 = 240. The answer is ###{240}."

Since the ratio of whole wheat to white bread is 5:3, the bakery sells 5 parts of whole wheat bread for every 8 parts total. So, the number of loaves of whole wheat bread sold is 5 x 60 = 300.

If they make a profit of 25% on the sale of whole wheat bread and 15% on the sale of white bread, how much profit do they make from selling bread in a day?",
        "answer": "First, let's find the profit from the sale of whole wheat bread. They sell 480 loaves per day at $2.50 per loaf, so the revenue from whole wheat bread is 480 x $2.50 = $1200. Since they make a 25% profit, the profit from whole wheat bread is $1200 x 25/100 = $300. Next, let's find the profit from the sale of white bread. They sell 480 loaves per day at $1.75 per loaf, so the revenue from white bread is 480 x $1.75 = $840. Since they make a 15% profit, the profit from white bread is $840 x 15/100 = $126.

        "answer": "Let's denote the number of white bread loaves as W and the number of whole wheat bread loaves as WW. Since they sell 30% more whole wheat bread, we can write the equation WW = W + 0.3W = 1.3W. We know that WW + W = 480. Substituting WW from the first equation, we get 1.3W + W = 2.3W = 480. Solving for W, we get W = 480 / 2.3 = 208.69. Since we can't sell a fraction of a loaf, we round down to 208 loaves of white bread.

If they sell 60 more whole wheat loaves than white bread loaves, and each whole wheat loaf costs $2 more than each white loaf, and each white loaf costs $2, how much more money does the bakery make from selling whole wheat loaves compared to white bread loaves?",
        "answer": "Let's denote the number of white bread loaves as x. Then, the number of whole wheat loaves is x + 60. The total number of loaves is 480, so we can set up the equation x + (x + 60) = 480. Combining like terms, we get 2x + 60 = 480. Subtracting 60 from both sides, we get 2x = 420. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 210. So, the number of white bread loaves is 210 and the number of whole wheat loaves is 210 + 60 = 270. Since each white loaf costs $2 and each whole wheat loaf costs $4, the total revenue from white bread is 210 x $2 = $420 and the total revenue from whole wheat bread is 270 x $4 = $1080.

        "answer": "Let's represent the number of oatmeal raisin cookies as x. Since they sell 60 more boxes of chocolate chip cookies, the number of chocolate chip cookies is x + 60. The total number of cookies is the sum of these two types, which is x + (x + 60) = 2x + 60. We know this total is 480, so we can set up the equation 2x + 60 = 480. To solve for x, we subtract 60 from both sides: 2x = 420. Then we divide by 2: x = 210.

The item that costs $25 is under $50, so we don't need to give a discount on it. The total cost of the items is $67.50 + $25 = $92.50. Therefore, the customer will pay $92.50 - $7.50 = $85 after the discount. Answer is ###{85}."

The large boxes contain 24 cookies and the small boxes contain 12 cookies. If the number of large boxes is 3 times the number of small boxes, how many small boxes were sold?",
        "answer": "Let's say the number of small boxes sold is x. Then the number of large boxes sold is 3x. We know that the total number of boxes sold is 480, so x + 3x = 480. Combining like terms, we get 4x = 480. Dividing both sides by 4, we get x = 120. So, the number of small boxes sold is 120. Answer is ###{120}."

        "question": "A bakery is making a special batch of cookies. They need 2/3 of a cup of sugar for each batch of cookies, and they want to make 5 batches. If they already have 5 3/4 cups of sugar, how many more cups of sugar do they need to buy?",
        "answer": "To find out how much sugar they need in total, we need to multiply the amount of sugar needed for each batch by the number of batches. 2/3 cup * 5 = (2 * 5) / 3 = 10/3 cups. To add 5 3/4 cups and 10/3 cups, we need to find a common denominator, which is 12. So, 5 3/4 cups is equal to (5 * 12 + 3) / 12 = 69/12 cups. Now we can add them together: 69/12 + 10/3 = (69 + 40) / 12 = 109/12 cups. To convert this to a mixed number, we divide 109 by 12: 109 \u00f7 12 = 9 with a remainder of 1. So, the total amount of sugar they need is 9 1/12 cups. Since they already have 5 3/4 cups, they need to buy 9 1/12 - 5 3/4 = 3 7/12 cups more. To subtract these mixed numbers, we need to find a common denominator, which is 12. So, 5 3/4 is equal to 69/12 and 9 1/12 is equal to 109/12. Now we can subtract them: 109/12 - 69/12 = (109 - 69) / 12 = 40/12. To convert this to a mixed number, we divide 40 by 12: 40 \u00f7 12 = 3 with a remainder of 4. So, the amount of sugar they need to buy is 3 1/3 cups. Answer is ###{3 1/3}."

        "answer": "Since they sell 3/5 of their bread as whole wheat, they sell 2/5 as white bread. To find the number of white bread loaves, we need to multiply the total number of loaves by 2/5. 2/5 of 480 is (2/5) x 480 = (2 x 480)/5 = 960/5 = 192.

The combined rate is 1/6 + 1/8 = (4+3)/24 = 7/24 tank per hour. To find the time it takes to fill the tank, we can divide 1 tank by the combined rate: 1 / (7/24) = 24/7 hours.

        "answer": "First, we need to find the net rate at which the tank is being filled. The 3 people filling the tank are adding 3 x 20 = 60 liters per minute. The 2 people draining the tank are subtracting 2 x 10 = 20 liters per minute. So, the net rate is 60 - 20 = 40 liters per minute.

        "answer": "Let's start by finding the number of small boxes sold. 1/5 of the total boxes were sold as small boxes, so the number of small boxes is 1/5 x 480 = 96. Since each small box contains 8 pastries, the total number of pastries in the small boxes is 96 x 8 = 768. The total number of pastries in all the boxes is 480 x 24 = 11520. To find the total number of pastries in the large boxes, we subtract the number of pastries in the small boxes from the total number of pastries. So, the number of pastries in the large boxes is 11520 - 768 = 10952. Since each large box contains 24 pastries, the number of large boxes sold is 10952 / 24 = 456. The answer is ###{456}."

        "answer": "Let's assume the number of oatmeal raisin cookies sold is x. Then, the number of chocolate chip cookies sold is x + 120. We know that x + (x + 120) = 480, so 2x + 120 = 480, 2x = 360, x = 180. So, the number of oatmeal raisin cookies sold is 180 and the number of chocolate chip cookies sold is 180 + 120 = 300. The total money made from oatmeal raisin cookies is $1.50 x 180 = $270 and from chocolate chip cookies is $2 x 300 = $600. Therefore, the total money made is $270 + $600 = $870. Answer is ###{870}."

        "answer": "Let's say the number of white loaves is x. Since they sell 60 more whole wheat loaves, the number of whole wheat loaves is x + 60. We know that the total number of loaves is 480, so we can set up the equation x + (x + 60) = 480. Combining like terms, we get 2x + 60 = 480. Subtracting 60 from both sides gives 2x = 420.

        "answer": "Since 60% of their bread sales are whole wheat, 40% are white bread. We know they sell 180 loaves of white bread, which is 40% of the total. To find the total number of loaves, we can set up the equation: 40% of total = 180. To find 100% of the total, we can divide 180 by 40% (or 0.4), which gives us 450. So, the total number of loaves of bread they sell is 450. Now, we can find the number of whole wheat loaves by multiplying the total number of loaves by 60% (or 0.6): 450 x 0.6 = 270.

        "answer": "To find the total profit in a day, we need to multiply the number of loaves sold by the profit per loaf. So, 480 loaves * $0.50 = $<<480*0.5=240>>240 per day. To find the total profit in a week, we need to multiply the daily profit by 7. So, $240 * 7 = $<<240*7=1680>>1680 per week. The answer is ###{1680}."

        "answer": "Let's represent the number of white bread loaves as W and the number of whole wheat loaves as WW. We know that W + WW = 480 and WW = W + 60. We can substitute the second equation into the first one: W + (W + 60) = 480. Simplifying the equation, we get 2W + 60 = 480. Subtracting 60 from both sides, we get 2W = 420. Dividing both sides by 2, we get W = 210. Since WW = W + 60, WW = 210 + 60 = 270. So, the bakery sold 270 whole wheat loaves. Answer is ###{270}."

        "answer": "To find the total number of days, we need to calculate how many feet the snail climbs in a day. The snail climbs 3 feet up during the day, but slips 2 feet back at night, so it effectively climbs 3 - 2 = 1 foot per day. To find the number of days it takes to climb 20 feet, we can divide 20 by 1 and round up to the nearest whole number because the snail won't be able to climb a fraction of a foot on the last day. So, it will take the snail 20 / 1 = 20 days to climb 20 feet. Answer is ###{20}."

        "answer": "First, we need to find the discount on each type of bread. The discount on the regular loaf is 15% of $2.50, which is 0.15 x $2.50 = $<<0.15*2.5=0.375>>0.375. The discount on the whole wheat loaf is 20% of $3.25, which is 0.20 x $3.25 = $0.65. The sale price of the regular loaves is $2.50 - $0.375 = $2.125 each, and the sale price of the whole wheat loaf is $3.25 - $0.65 = $2.60.

        "answer": "Let d be the number of days it takes for the snail to reach the top of the well. We know that the snail climbs 3 meters each day and slips back 2 meters each night. So, the net distance it covers each day is 3 - 2 = 1 meter. To reach the top of the well, the snail needs to cover 15 meters. So, the number of days it takes is 15 / 1 = 15. However, this is not the correct answer because it doesn't take into account the last day when the snail will climb the remaining 3 meters without slipping back. Therefore, the correct number of days is 15 - 1 + 1 = 15. But we can also solve this problem by using the formula for the total distance covered by the snail: 15 = 3d - 2(d-1). We can simplify the equation to get 15 = 5 - 2d. Then, we can solve for d by subtracting 5 from both sides to get -10 = -2d and then dividing both sides by -2 to get d = 5.

        "answer": "Let's denote the number of white bread loaves as W and whole wheat loaves as WW. We know that WW = W + 60. We also know that WW + W = 480 and WW = 1/4 * 480 = 120. We can substitute WW with W + 60 in the second equation: (W + 60) + W = 480. Simplifying the equation, we get 2W + 60 = 480. Subtracting 60 from both sides, we get 2W = 420.

If Sarah already has 120 books, she has used 120 / 8 = 15 shelves. Since there are only 5 shelves, she has used all of them. However, she can't put more books on the shelves because they are full. To find how many more books she can put, we need to find the remaining space on the full shelves. Since all shelves are full, there is no remaining space. However, we can calculate how many more books she can add to the shelves if she removes some books from the shelves. If she removes 8 books from each shelf, she can add 8 more books to each shelf.

If they sell 60 more loaves of whole wheat bread than white bread and they sell 1/4 of their total loaves as whole wheat, how many loaves of white bread do they sell?",
        "answer": "Let's start by finding 1/4 of the total number of loaves sold. 1/4 of 480 is 480/4 = 120. This is the number of loaves of whole wheat bread. Since they sell 60 more loaves of whole wheat bread than white bread, the number of loaves of white bread is 120 - 60 = 60. The answer is ###{60}."

        "answer": "To find the number of days it takes for the snail to reach the top of the well, we need to calculate the distance the snail covers in a day. The snail climbs 3 feet up during the day, but slips back 2 feet at night, so it effectively covers 3 - 2 = 1 foot per day. To find the number of days it takes to climb 20 feet, we can divide the total distance by the daily progress: 20 / 1 = 20 days. However, since the snail climbs 1 foot on the last day, it will reach the top of the well on the 20th day. Answer is ###{20}."

        "answer": "Let's denote the number of white bread loaves as x. Since they sell 1/5 of the total loaves as whole wheat, the number of whole wheat loaves is (1/5) * 480 = 96. We are also given that they sell 60 more whole wheat loaves than white bread loaves, so we can set up the equation: 96 = x + 60. Solving for x, we get x = 96 - 60 = 36. So, they sell 36 loaves of white bread. Answer is ####{36}."

If they sell 5 times as many whole wheat loaves as white loaves, and 2 times as many white loaves as rye loaves, how many loaves of rye bread do they sell per day?",
        "answer": "Let's denote the number of rye loaves as x. Since they sell 2 times as many white loaves as rye loaves, the number of white loaves is 2x. And since they sell 5 times as many whole wheat loaves as white loaves, the number of whole wheat loaves is 5 * 2x = 10x. We know that the total number of loaves is 480, so we can set up the equation: x + 2x + 10x = 480. Combining like terms, we get 13x = 480. Dividing both sides by 13, we get x = 36.67.

        "answer": "First, let's find out how much money the bakery makes in a day. They sell 480 loaves of bread at $2 each, so they make 480 x $2 = $<<480*2=960>>960 per day.\nNext, let's find out how much they make in a week. Since they operate 7 days a week, they make 7 x $960 = $<<7*960=6720>>6720 per week.\nFinally, let's find out how much they make in a month. Since they operate 4 weeks a month, they make 4 x $6720 = $<<4*6720=26880>>26880 per month.\nTherefore, the bakery makes $26880 in a month. ###{26880}"

        "answer": "Let's represent the number of whole wheat loaves as 3x and the number of white loaves as 5x. We know that the ratio of whole wheat to white bread is 3:5, and they sell 40 more loaves of white bread than whole wheat. This can be represented as 5x = 3x + 40. To solve for x, we subtract 3x from both sides: 2x = 40. Then, we divide both sides by 2: x = 20. Since the number of whole wheat loaves is 3x, we multiply 3 by 20 to get 60. So, the bakery sells 60 loaves of whole wheat bread. The total number of loaves is 60 + 100 = 160. The answer is ###{60}."

        "answer": "The number of cookies from small boxes is 12x and the number of cookies from large boxes is 24(480 - x). To find the total number of cookies, we need to add the number of cookies from both types of boxes. So, the total number of cookies is 12x + 24(480 - x). To simplify this, we can use the distributive property: 12x + 24(480 - x) = 12x + 11520 - 24x. Combining like terms, we get -12x + 11520. So, the total number of cookies is -12x + 11520. However, we want to find a numerical answer, so we need more information about the value of x. But if we assume x = 0, then the total number of cookies is 11520.

        "answer": "First, let's find out how much sugar and flour is needed for one batch. The recipe requires 2/4 cup of sugar, which can be simplified to 1/2 cup, and 3/4 cup of flour. To make 6 batches, we need to multiply the ingredients by 6. So, for sugar, we need 1/2 cup x 6 = 3 cups. For flour, we need 3/4 cup x 6 = 4.5 cups. Therefore, the bakery needs 3 cups of sugar and 4.5 cups of flour in total. ###{3, 4.5}"

        "answer": "Let's say the number of chocolate cupcakes sold is x. Then, the number of vanilla cupcakes sold is x + 120. The total number of cupcakes is 480, so we can set up the equation x + (x + 120) = 480. Combining like terms, we get 2x + 120 = 480. Subtracting 120 from both sides, we get 2x = 360. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 180. So, they sold 180 chocolate cupcakes and 180 + 120 = 300 vanilla cupcakes. The total money made from chocolate cupcakes is 180 x $3 = $540. The total money made from vanilla cupcakes is 300 x $2 = $600. Therefore, the total money made is $540 + $600 = $1140. Answer is ####{1140}."

Next, we need to calculate the discount, which is 15% of $50. 15% of 50 is 0.15 x 50 = $7.50. To find the final cost, we subtract the discount from the original cost: 50 - 7.50 = $<<50-7.50=42.50>>42.50. The customer will pay $42.50 after the discount. ###{42.50}"

Combining like terms, we get 8x = 480. Dividing both sides by 8, we find that x = 60. Since the number of large boxes is 5x, we multiply 5 by 60 to get 300.

        "answer": "Let's assume the number of large boxes is x. Then the number of small boxes is 3x. We know that the total number of boxes is 480, so we can write the equation x + 3x = 480. Combining like terms, we get 4x = 480. Dividing both sides by 4, we get x = 120. Since x represents the number of large boxes, the number of small boxes is 3x = 3 x 120 = 360. Answer is ####{360}."

        "answer": "Let's first find the total number of whole wheat loaves. Since they sell 3/5 of their bread as whole wheat, we can multiply 480 by 3/5. 480 x 3/5 = (480 x 3) / 5 = 1440 / 5 = 288. So, they sell 288 loaves of whole wheat bread. The number of white bread loaves is the total number of loaves minus the number of whole wheat loaves. 480 - 288 = 192.

        "answer": "Let's say they sell x bags of 6 loaves and x bags of 8 loaves. Since they sell the same number of bags of each type, we can set up the equation: 6x + 8x = 240. Combining like terms, we get 14x = 240. Dividing both sides by 14, we get x = 240 / 14 = 17.1. Since we can't sell a fraction of a bag, we round down to 17 bags of each type. The number of loaves in 17 bags of 6 loaves is 17 x 6 = 102. The number of loaves in 17 bags of 8 loaves is 17 x 8 = 136. The total number of loaves is 102 + 136 = 238. We are missing 2 loaves, so the bakery must sell 17 bags of 6 loaves and 17 bags of 8 loaves, with 2 loaves left over.

        "answer": "To find the total cost, we need to calculate the discount on each item first. The discount on a loaf of bread is 15% of $2.50, which is $2.50 x 0.15 = $0.375. So, the sale price of a loaf of bread is $2.50 - $0.375 = $2.125. The discount on a jar of jam is 10% of $1.75, which is $1.75 x 0.10 = $0.175. So, the sale price of a jar of jam is $1.75 - $0.175 = $1.575. Sarah buys 2 loaves of bread, so the total cost of the bread is 2 x $2.125 = $4.25. The total cost of the jam is $1.575.

        "question": "A bakery sells 250 loaves of bread per day. They make a profit of $0.50 on each loaf of whole wheat bread and a profit of $0.25 on each loaf of white bread. If they sell 2/3 of their bread as whole wheat and the rest as white, how much profit do they make in a day?",
        "answer": "First, let's find out how many loaves of whole wheat and white bread they sell per day. They sell 2/3 of 250 loaves as whole wheat, which is 250 x 2/3 = 166.67 loaves. Since they can't sell a fraction of a loaf, we'll round down to 166 loaves of whole wheat bread. The rest, 250 - 166 = 84 loaves, are white bread. The profit from whole wheat bread is 166 x $0.50 = $83. The profit from white bread is 84 x $0.25 = $21. So, the total profit is $83 + $21 = $104. Answer is ###{104}."

        "answer": "To find the number of shelves that will be completely filled, we need to divide the total number of books by the number of books each shelf can hold. 120 books / 8 books per shelf = 15. Since we can't have a fraction of a shelf, we take the integer part, which is 15. However, since there are only 5 shelves, only 5 shelves will be completely filled. The remaining books will be placed on the last shelf. So, the number of shelves that will be completely filled is ###{5}."

        "answer": "To find the total daily profit, we need to calculate the profit from whole wheat bread and white bread separately. They sell 2/3 of 250 loaves as whole wheat, which is (2/3) x 250 = 166.67 loaves. So, the profit from whole wheat bread is 166.67 x $0.50 = $83.335. They sell 1/3 of 250 loaves as white bread, which is (1/3) x 250 = 83.33 loaves. So, the profit from white bread is 83.33 x $0.25 = $20.833. The total daily profit is $83.335 + $20.833 = $104.168.

        "question": "A bakery sells a total of 480 boxes of cookies in a day. They sell a combination of chocolate chip and oatmeal raisin cookies. If they sell 60 more boxes of oatmeal raisin cookies than chocolate chip cookies, and they sell 1/4 as many boxes of oatmeal raisin cookies as they do chocolate chip cookies, how many boxes of chocolate chip cookies did they sell?",
        "answer": "Let's say the number of chocolate chip cookies is x. Then the number of oatmeal raisin cookies is x + 60. Since they sell 1/4 as many oatmeal raisin cookies as chocolate chip cookies, we can set up the equation: x + (x + 60) = 480. Combining like terms, we get 2x + 60 = 480. Subtracting 60 from both sides gives us 2x = 420. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 210. So, they sold 210 boxes of chocolate chip cookies. ###{210}."

        "answer": "To find the area of a circle, we need to use the formula A = \u03c0r^2. We have two circles with radii of 4 inches and 8 inches. For the first circle, the area is A1 = \u03c0(4)^2 = \u03c0(16) = 3.14159 * 16 = 50.2655. For the second circle, the area is A2 = \u03c0(8)^2 = \u03c0(64) = 3.14159 * 64 = 201.06176. The total area is A1 + A2 = 50.2655 + 201.06176 = 251.32726. The final answer is ###{251.32726}."

        "answer": "To find the total number of boxes the bookshelf can hold, we need to multiply the number of shelves by the number of boxes each shelf can hold: 5 shelves * 8 boxes/shelf = 40 boxes. Since 48 boxes have already been placed, we need to subtract this from the total capacity to find the remaining space: 40 boxes - 48 boxes = -8 boxes. However, since we can't have a negative number of boxes, we know that the bookshelf is full and can't hold any more boxes. Answer is ###{0}."

        "answer": "To find the number of gallons already in the tank, we need to calculate 3/4 of 2400. 3/4 x 2400 = 1800 gallons. To find the remaining gallons, we subtract 1800 from 2400. 2400 - 1800 = 600 gallons. Since 120 gallons are added every hour, we need to divide 600 by 120 to find the number of hours it will take to fill the tank. 600 / 120 = 5 hours. Answer is ###{5}."

Now we can use the formula A = \u03c0r^2 to find the area. Plugging in the value of r, we get A = \u03c0(7)^2 = 3.14 * 49 = 154.06. Therefore, the area of the garden is ###{154.06}."

        "answer": "To find the net rate at which the tank is being filled, we need to subtract the rate at which water is being drained from the rate at which it's being pumped in. The net rate is 120 - 60 = 60 liters per minute. To find the time it takes to fill the tank, we need to divide the total capacity of the tank by the net rate. 2400 / 60 = 40 minutes. Therefore, it will take 40 minutes to fill the tank. ###{40}."

        "answer": "First, let's find out how much money Maya has in total. She has $120 in her piggy bank and receives a $25 gift card, so she now has 120 + 25 = 145 dollars. She also earns $15 for walking the dog, so now she has 145 + 15 = 160 dollars. To find out how much more money she needs to save, we need to subtract the cost of the bike from the total amount of money she has. 160 - 180 = -20. This means Maya needs to save 20 dollars more to buy the bike. Answer is ###{20}."

        "answer": "First, let's calculate the discount for each loaf. The regular loaf is 15% off, so the discount is 2.50 x 0.15 = 0.375. The new price for the regular loaf is 2.50 - 0.375 = 2.125. The whole wheat loaf is 20% off, so the discount is 3.25 x 0.20 = 0.65. The new price for the whole wheat loaf is 3.25 - 0.65 = 2.60. To find the total cost, we add the prices of both loaves: 2.125 + 2.60 = 4.725. So, you will pay $###{4.725} for one regular loaf and one whole wheat loaf during the sale."

The bookshelf has 120 books and each shelf can hold 8 books. So, the number of shelves used is 120 / 8 = 15. Since the bookshelf has 5 shelves, the number of empty shelves is 5 - 15 = -10. However, a negative number of empty shelves doesn't make sense in this context. This is because the bookshelf has more books than it can hold. So, the correct interpretation is that all shelves will be filled and there will be 15 - 5 = 10 books left over. Answer is ###{10}."

The total income from whole wheat bread is $2.50 * 180 = $450 and the total income from white bread is $2.20 * 300 = $660. The total income is $450 + $660 = $<<2.50*180=450>>450 + $<<2.20*300=660>>660 = $1110. ###{1110}"

        "answer": "To find the total cost, we need to calculate the sale price of each loaf of bread. The regular loaf is 15% off, so the discount is $2.50 x 0.15 = $0.375. The sale price of the regular loaf is $2.50 - $0.375 = $2.125. The whole wheat loaf is 20% off, so the discount is $3.25 x 0.20 = $0.65. The sale price of the whole wheat loaf is $3.25 - $0.65 = $2.60. Since Sarah buys 2 regular loaves and 1 whole wheat loaf, the total cost is 2 x $2.125 + $2.60 = $5.45. Answer is ###{5.45}."

        "answer": "Since they sold 3/5 of the total boxes in the morning, they sold 2/5 of the total boxes in the afternoon. To find the number of boxes sold in the afternoon, we need to multiply the total number of boxes by 2/5. 2/5 * 480 = (2 * 480) / 5 = 960 / 5 = 192. So, the bakery sold 192 boxes in the afternoon.

        "answer": "To find the amount of water already in the tank, we need to multiply the total capacity by the fraction that is full. 1200 x 3/5 = 720 gallons. To find the amount of water needed to fill the tank, we need to subtract the amount already in the tank from the total capacity. 1200 - 720 = 480 gallons. Since water is flowing into the tank at 10 gallons per minute, we can find the time it will take to fill the tank by dividing the amount needed by the rate. 480 / 10 = 48 minutes. Answer is ###{48}."

        "answer": "To find the number of hours it will take to fill the tank, we need to subtract the current amount of water from the total capacity of the tank. The tank can hold 240 liters, but it already has 120 liters, so there are 240 - 120 = 120 liters left to fill. If 15 liters are added every hour, we can find the number of hours it will take to fill the tank by dividing the remaining liters by the amount added per hour: 120 / 15 = 8 hours. So, it will take 8 hours to fill the tank. ###{8}"

        "answer": "To find the number of weeks it will take Maya to save enough money, we need to subtract the amount she already has from the price of the bike. This will give us the amount she still needs to save. The amount she needs to save is $180 - $120 = $60. Since she saves $15 each week, we can find the number of weeks by dividing the amount she needs to save by the amount she saves each week. So, $60 / $15 = 4 weeks. Answer is ###{4}."

        "answer": "Let's assume the number of large boxes sold is x. Then, the number of small boxes sold is x + 40. We know that the total number of boxes sold is 480, so we can write the equation: x + (x + 40) = 480. Simplifying the equation, we get 2x + 40 = 480. Subtracting 40 from both sides, we get 2x = 440.

        "answer": "First, let's calculate the discount for each loaf. The regular loaf has a discount of 15%, so the discount amount is 2.50 x 0.15 = $0.375. Therefore, the sale price of the regular loaf is 2.50 - 0.375 = $2.125. The whole wheat loaf has a discount of 20%, so the discount amount is 3.25 x 0.20 = $0.65. Therefore, the sale price of the whole wheat loaf is 3.25 - 0.65 = $2.60. To find the total cost, add the prices of the two loaves: 2.125 + 2.60 = $4.725. Answer is ###{4.725}."

        "answer": "Let's denote the number of whole wheat bread as W and the number of rye bread as R. We know that W + R = 480 and 2W + 1.5R = 900. We can multiply the first equation by 1.5 to get 1.5W + 1.5R = 720. Now we can subtract this equation from the second equation to get 0.5W = 180. Dividing both sides by 0.5, we get W = 360. Substituting this into the first equation, we get 360 + R = 480, so R = 120. The bakery sold 120 loaves of rye bread. ###{120}"

        "answer": "Let's say they sell x boxes of chocolate chip cookies. Then, they sell (x + 60) boxes of oatmeal raisin cookies. The total number of boxes sold is x + (x + 60) = 480. Combining like terms, we get 2x + 60 = 480. Subtracting 60 from both sides, we get 2x = 420. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 210.

        "answer": "Let's denote the number of whole wheat bread as 5x and the number of white bread as 4x. Since the total number of bread is 480, we can set up the equation 5x + 4x = 480. Combining like terms, we get 9x = 480. To solve for x, we divide both sides by 9: x = 480 / 9 = 53.33. Since x represents the multiplier for the ratio, we multiply it by the number of whole wheat bread in the ratio: 5 * 53.33 = 266.65. However, the number of loaves must be a whole number. We can round down to the nearest whole number since you can't sell a fraction of a loaf. Therefore, the bakery sells approximately 266 loaves of whole wheat bread per day. Answer is ###{266}."

        "answer": "To find the total cost of the bread, we need to calculate the sale price of each type of bread. The regular loaf is on sale for 15% off, so the sale price is 2.50 x (1 - 0.15) = 2.50 x 0.85 = 2.125.

        "answer": "Let's use the ratio to set up an equation. Let x be the multiplier for the ratio. The total number of parts in the ratio is 3 + 5 = 8. Since the total number of loaves sold is 480, we can set up the equation 8x = 480. To solve for x, we divide both sides by 8: x = 480 / 8 = 60. Now that we have the multiplier, we can find the number of whole wheat loaves sold by multiplying the number of parts for whole wheat (3) by the multiplier (60): 3 x 60 = 180.

        "answer": "To find the discount on the regular loaf, we need to calculate 15% of $2.50. 15% of $2.50 is 0.15 x 2.50 = $0.375. So, the discount on the regular loaf is $0.375. The sale price of the regular loaf will be 2.50 - 0.375 = $2.125. To find the discount on the whole wheat loaf, we need to calculate 20% of $3.25. 20% of $3.25 is 0.20 x 3.25 = $0.65. So, the discount on the whole wheat loaf is $0.65. The sale price of the whole wheat loaf will be 3.25 - 0.65 = $2.60.

        "answer": "To find the number of liters already in the tank, we need to calculate 3/4 of 2400. 3/4 of 2400 is 2400 * (3/4) = 1800 liters. If 120 liters are added to the tank, the total number of liters in the tank will be 1800 + 120 = 1920 liters. Since the tank can hold 2400 liters, the number of liters that can still be added is 2400 - 1920 = 480. The answer is ###{480}."

        "answer": "Let's denote the number of white loaves as W. We are given that W + (W + 30) = 240, since they sell 30 more whole wheat loaves than white loaves. Combining like terms, we get 2W + 30 = 240. Subtracting 30 from both sides, we get 2W = 210. Dividing both sides by 2, we get W = 105. So, they sell 105 loaves of white bread.

        "answer": "To find the total amount of sugar and flour needed, we need to calculate the amount needed for one batch and multiply it by 3. One batch requires 2/3 cup of sugar and 1/4 cup of flour. So, for 3 batches, they need 3 x 2/3 = 6/3 = 2 cups of sugar and 3 x 1/4 = 3/4 cups of flour. To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 4. So, we can rewrite 2 cups as 8/4 cups. Now we can add the fractions: 8/4 + 3/4 = 11/4 cups of sugar and 3/4 cups of flour. So, the total amount of sugar and flour needed is 11/4 cups of sugar and 3/4 cups of flour. Answer is ###{11/4, 3/4}."

        "question": "A bakery sells a total of 480 cookies in a day. They sell a combination of chocolate chip and oatmeal raisin cookies. If they sell chocolate chip cookies for $1 each and oatmeal raisin cookies for $1.25 each, and they make a total of $525, how many chocolate chip cookies did they sell?",
        "answer": "Let's say the number of chocolate chip cookies sold is x. Then, the number of oatmeal raisin cookies sold is 480 - x. The total revenue from chocolate chip cookies is $1x and the total revenue from oatmeal raisin cookies is $1.25(480 - x). The total revenue is $525, so we can set up the equation $1x + $1.25(480 - x) = $525. We can simplify the equation to $1x + $600 - $1.25x = $525, which becomes -$0.25x = -$75. Dividing both sides by -0.25, we get x = 300. So, they sold 300 chocolate chip cookies. Answer is ###{300}."

        "question": "A bakery is having a sale on bread. A regular loaf of bread normally costs $2.50, but it's on sale for 15% off. A whole wheat loaf of bread normally costs $3.25, but it's on sale for 20% off. How much will you pay for one regular loaf of bread and one whole wheat loaf of bread during the sale?",
        "answer": "First, let's calculate the discount for each type of bread. The regular loaf of bread is on sale for 15% off, so the discount is $2.50 x 0.15 = $0.375. The whole wheat loaf of bread is on sale for 20% off, so the discount is $3.25 x 0.20 = $0.65. To find the sale price of each type of bread, we subtract the discount from the original price. The sale price of the regular loaf of bread is $2.50 - $0.375 = $2.125. The sale price of the whole wheat loaf of bread is $3.25 - $0.65 = $2.60. To find the total cost, we add the sale prices of both loaves of bread: $2.125 + $2.60 = $4.725. Answer is ###{4.725}."

        "answer": "Let's say the number of premium boxes sold is x. Since they sell 3 times as many regular boxes, the number of regular boxes sold is 3x. The total number of boxes sold is 4x. We know that the total number of boxes sold is 480, so we can set up the equation 4x = 480. To solve for x, we divide both sides by 4: x = 480 / 4 = 120. So, the number of premium boxes sold is 120.

To find the number of days, we need to subtract the distance it slips from the total distance. The total distance is 20 feet, and it slips 2 feet each night. So, the effective distance it moves up is 3 - 2 = 1 foot per day. To find the number of days, we divide the total distance by the distance it moves up each day: 20 / 1 = 20 days.

        "answer": "Let's say the number of whole wheat bread sold is x. Then, the number of rye bread sold is 480 - x. The total amount of money made from selling whole wheat bread is 2x. The total amount of money made from selling rye bread is 1.50(480 - x). We know that the total amount of money made is $840. So, we can write the equation: 2x + 1.50(480 - x) = 840. Simplifying the equation, we get 2x + 720 - 1.50x = 840. Combine like terms to get 0.50x = 120. Divide both sides by 0.50 to get x = 240. So, the number of whole wheat bread sold is 240.

Since each batch makes 12 cookies, they will need 60 cookies / 12 cookies/batch = 5 batches.\nSince each batch requires 2/3 cup of sugar, the total amount of sugar needed is 5 batches x 2/3 cup/batch = 10/3 cups.\nTo simplify the fraction, we can divide the numerator by the denominator: 10 \u00f7 3 = 3.33 cups. So, they will need approximately 3.33 cups of sugar. Answer is ###{3.33}."

        "question": "A bakery sells a total of 480 loaves of bread per day. They sell white bread for $2 per loaf and whole wheat bread for $2.50 per loaf. If they sell 60 more loaves of whole wheat bread than white bread, how much money does the bakery make in a day?",
        "answer": "Let's say they sell x loaves of white bread. Then they sell x + 60 loaves of whole wheat bread. The total number of loaves is x + (x + 60) = 480. Combining like terms, we get 2x + 60 = 480. Subtracting 60 from both sides, we get 2x = 420. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 210. So they sell 210 loaves of white bread and 210 + 60 = 270 loaves of whole wheat bread. The total amount of money they make from white bread is 210 x $2 = $420. The total amount of money they make from whole wheat bread is 270 x $2.50 = $675. Therefore, the total amount of money they make in a day is $420 + $675 = $1095. Answer is ###{1095}."

        "answer": "Let's denote the number of whole wheat bread as x and the number of white bread as y. We know that x + y = 480 and x = y + 60. We can substitute the second equation into the first one: (y + 60) + y = 480, which simplifies to 2y + 60 = 480. Subtracting 60 from both sides gives us 2y = 420. Dividing both sides by 2 gives us y = 210. So, the bakery sells 210 loaves of white bread. Answer is ###{210}."

        "answer": "First, we need to find the total number of books the bookshelf can hold. There are 5 shelves with 8 books on each shelf, so the total number of books the bookshelf can hold is 5 x 8 = 40. Since the bookshelf already has 120 books, we need to subtract 120 from 40 to find out how many more books can be added. 40 - 120 is not possible, but since the bookshelf already has more books than it can hold, we need to find the remaining space. The bookshelf can hold 40 books, and it already has 120, so we need to find how many books can be removed to make it full. The remaining space is 120 - 40 = 80 books. But this is not the answer we are looking for, we are looking for how many more books can be added. Since the bookshelf already has more books than it can hold, we need to find the difference between the number of books it can hold and the number of books it already has. The bookshelf can hold 40 books, and it already has 120 books, so the number of books that can be removed is 120 - 40 = 80. But this is the number of books that can be removed, we need to find the number of books that can be added. Since the bookshelf already has 80 more books than it can hold, we need to find the number of books that can be removed to make it full. The bookshelf can hold 40 books, and it needs 80 books to be removed to be full, so the number of books that can be added is 0. However, this is not the correct answer, we need to find the number of books that can be added before the bookshelf is full. Since the bookshelf already has 120 books, and it can hold 40 books, the correct answer is that the bookshelf is already full, and no more books can be added. Answer is ###{0}."

        "answer": "Let's denote the number of chocolate chip cookies as 5x and the number of oatmeal raisin cookies as 3x. The total number of cookies is 5x + 3x = 8x. Since the total number of cookies sold is 480, we can set up the equation 8x = 480. Solving for x, we get x = 480 / 8 = 60. So, the number of chocolate chip cookies sold is 5x = 5 * 60 = 300.

        "answer": "Let's first find the total number of parts in the ratio, which is 3 + 5 = 8. Since the total number of loaves of bread sold is 480, we can divide 480 by 8 to find the value of 1 part. 480 / 8 = 60. Now, we can multiply the value of 1 part by the number of parts for each type of bread. There are 3 parts for whole wheat bread, so 3 x 60 = 180 loaves of whole wheat bread were sold. There are 5 parts for white bread, so 5 x 60 = 300 loaves of white bread were sold. The difference between the number of white bread loaves and whole wheat bread loaves is 300 - 180 = 120. There are 120 more loaves of white bread than whole wheat bread sold. ###{120}."

We know that x + (x + 60) = 480. To find the value of x, we need to solve the equation: 2x + 60 = 480. Subtracting 60 from both sides gives us 2x = 420. Dividing both sides by 2 gives us x = 210. Since x represents the number of white bread loaves, we can find the number of whole wheat loaves by substituting x into the expression x + 60: 210 + 60 = 270.

        "answer": "To find the total weight, we need to add the weight of the large loaves and the small loaves. 5 large loaves have 5 x 2.5 = 12.5 kg. 8 small loaves have 8 x 1.2 = 9.6 kg. So, the total weight is 12.5 + 9.6 = 22.1 kg. Answer is ###{22.1}."

        "answer": "Let's denote the number of white bread loaves as W and the number of whole wheat loaves as WW. We know that W + WW = 250 and WW = W + 30. We can substitute the second equation into the first one: W + (W + 30) = 250. This simplifies to 2W + 30 = 250. Subtracting 30 from both sides gives us 2W = 220. Dividing both sides by 2 gives us W = 110. Since WW = W + 30, we can substitute W = 110 into this equation to get WW = 110 + 30 = 140. So, the bakery sells 140 whole wheat loaves. Answer is ###{140}."

So, the sale price for 1 loaf of bread is $2.50 - $0.375 = $2.125. Since the customer is buying 4 loaves of bread, the total price will be 4 x $2.125 = $8.50.

        "answer": "Let's use 'x' to represent the number of white loaves. We know they sold 60 more whole wheat loaves, so the number of whole wheat loaves is x + 60. We also know they sold a total of 200 white loaves, so the total number of loaves is x + (x + 60). We can set up an equation to represent this: x + (x + 60) = 480. Combining like terms, we get 2x + 60 = 480. Subtracting 60 from both sides, we get 2x = 420. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 210. So the number of white loaves is 210.

So, the total number of loaves made in the morning and afternoon is 96 + 160 = 256 loaves. Since they make 480 loaves in total, the number of loaves made in the evening is 480 - 256 = 224 loaves. The answer is ###{224}."

        "question": "A bakery sells a total of 480 boxes of cookies in a day. They sell a combination of large and small boxes. A large box contains 24 cookies and a small box contains 12 cookies. If they sell 3 times as many large boxes as small boxes, how many small boxes did they sell?",
        "answer": "Let's say the number of small boxes sold is x. Since they sell 3 times as many large boxes, the number of large boxes sold is 3x. The total number of boxes sold is 4x (x small + 3x large). We know this is equal to 480, so we can set up the equation: 4x = 480. To solve for x, we divide both sides by 4: x = 480 / 4 = 120. So, they sold 120 small boxes. Answer is ###{120}."

        "question": "A bakery is making a special batch of cookies that require 2/3 cup of sugar for every 12 cookies. If they need to make 48 cookies, how many cups of sugar will they need?",
        "answer": "To find the total amount of sugar needed, we need to determine how many sets of 12 cookies are in 48 cookies. 48 cookies / 12 cookies = 4 sets. Since each set requires 2/3 cup of sugar, we multiply the number of sets by the amount of sugar per set: 4 sets * 2/3 cup/set = 8/3 cup. To simplify the fraction, we can convert it to a mixed number: 8/3 = 2 2/3. So, the bakery will need 2 2/3 cups of sugar. Answer is ###{8/3}."

        "answer": "To find the total number of loaves of whole wheat bread, we need to find the total parts in the ratio and then find the fraction of whole wheat bread. The ratio of whole wheat to white bread is 5:3, which means there are 5 + 3 = 8 parts in total. The fraction of whole wheat bread is 5/8. To find the number of whole wheat bread, multiply the fraction by the total number of loaves: 5/8 * 480 = 300. So, the bakery sells 300 loaves of whole wheat bread per day. ###{300}"

        "answer": "Let's say the number of oatmeal raisin cookies sold is x. Then, the number of chocolate chip cookies sold is x + 60. Since the total number of boxes sold is 480, we can set up the equation x + (x + 60) = 480. Combining like terms, we get 2x + 60 = 480. Subtracting 60 from both sides, we get 2x = 420.

        "answer": "Let's say the number of sugar cookies sold is x. Since the number of oatmeal cookies sold is 40 more than the number of sugar cookies sold, the number of oatmeal cookies sold is x + 40. We know that the total number of cookies sold is 480. So, we can write the equation: x + (x + 40) = 480. Combining like terms, we get 2x + 40 = 480. Subtracting 40 from both sides, we get 2x = 440. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 220.

        "answer": "To find the total capacity of the bookshelf, we need to multiply the number of shelves by the number of books each shelf can hold. So, the total capacity is 5 x 8 = 40 books. Since the bookshelf already has 120 books, we need to subtract 120 from the total capacity to find out how many more books can be added. 40 - 120 = -80. Since we can't add a negative number of books, we need to find the maximum capacity of the bookshelf. The maximum capacity is the total capacity, which is 40. However, since the bookshelf already has 120 books, it's actually full. To find out how many more books can be added, we need to subtract the number of books already on the bookshelf from the maximum capacity of each shelf. Since each shelf can hold 8 books, the maximum number of books that can be added to the bookshelf is 5 x (8 - 24) = 5 x -16 = -80. However, this is incorrect, because you can't have a negative number of books. We need to recalculate the problem. The bookshelf can hold 5 x 8 = 40 books. It already has 120 books. To find out how many more books can be added, we need to subtract 120 from 40, which is incorrect. The bookshelf is actually full, and it can't hold any more books. The correct answer is that the bookshelf is full and can't hold any more books. The correct answer is ###{0}."

So, the total number of fruits is 24 + 15 = 39. Since Maya wants to put an equal number of fruits in each basket, we need to divide the total number of fruits by 3 (2 baskets of apples + 1 basket of oranges). 39 \u00f7 3 = 13.

The snail climbs 3 feet up and slips 2 feet back, so the net distance it travels each day is 3 - 2 = 1 foot. To reach the top of the 20-foot well, the snail needs to cover 20 - 0 = 20 feet. Since the snail travels 1 foot per day, it will take 20 / 1 = 20 days to reach the top.

        "answer": "First, let's find the discount on the regular loaves. 15% of $2.50 is 0.15 x $2.50 = $<<0.15*2.5=0.375>>0.375. So, each regular loaf will cost $2.50 - $0.375 = $2.125. For 2 regular loaves, the total cost will be 2 x $2.125 = $4.25. The discount on each regular loaf is $0.375, so the total discount on 2 regular loaves is 2 x $0.375 = $0.75. Next, let's find the discount on the whole wheat loaf. 20% of $3.25 is 0.20 x $3.25 = $0.65. So, the whole wheat loaf will cost $3.25 - $0.65 = $2.60. The total cost of all 3 loaves will be $4.25 + $2.60 = $6.85. The total discount will be $2.50 + $0.65 = $3.15. So, you will save a total of $3.15. ###{3.15}"

        "answer": "First, we need to find out how much distance the snail covers in a day. It climbs 3 feet up and slips back 2 feet, so it covers 3 - 2 = 1 foot per day. To find the number of days it takes to reach the top, we need to subtract the distance it slips back from the total height of the well: 20 feet - 2 feet = 18 feet. Now we divide the remaining distance by the distance it covers in a day: 18 feet / 1 foot/day = 18 days. So, it will take the snail 18 days to reach the top of the well. ###{18}"

If they sell 60 more chocolate chip cookies than oatmeal raisin cookies, and the number of oatmeal raisin cookies is 80, how many chocolate chip cookies did they sell?",
        "answer": "If the number of oatmeal raisin cookies is 80, and they sold 60 more chocolate chip cookies, then the number of chocolate chip cookies is 80 + 60 = 140. The total number of cookies is 480, so the number of oatmeal raisin cookies plus the number of chocolate chip cookies is 80 + 140 = 220. To find the number of chocolate chip cookies, we can subtract the number of oatmeal raisin cookies from the total: 480 - 80 = 400. Then we know that 400 = 140 + x.

        "answer": "Let's say the number of white bread loaves is x. Then, the number of whole wheat bread loaves is x + 60. We know that the total number of loaves is 480, so we can set up the equation x + (x + 60) = 480. Combining like terms, we get 2x + 60 = 480. Subtracting 60 from both sides, we get 2x = 420. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 210. This means they sell 210 loaves of white bread. Since they sell 60 more loaves of whole wheat bread, they sell 210 + 60 = 270 loaves of whole wheat bread.

The snail climbs 3 feet up and slips 2 feet back each day, so it effectively climbs 3 - 2 = 1 foot per day. To find the number of days it will take to climb 20 feet, we divide the total height by the distance climbed per day: 20 / 1 = 20 days. However, this is the number of days it would take if the snail didn't slip back at night. Since it slips back 2 feet each night, we need to add 2 feet to the total height for each day it climbs. So, the number of days it will take is 20 / 1 = 20 days. But, because it climbs 3 feet and slips 2 feet, it effectively climbs 1 foot per day. However, it will have to climb 20 feet and slip 2 feet back. So, on the 19th day, it will climb 3 feet and slip 2 feet back, leaving it 1 foot short of the top.

        "answer": "To find the number of days it takes for the snail to reach the top of the well, we need to calculate the total distance it covers each day. The snail climbs 3 feet up during the day and slips 2 feet back at night, so it effectively covers 3 - 2 = 1 foot per day. Since the well is 20 feet deep, the snail needs to cover 20 feet. Therefore, it will take the snail 20 / 1 = 20 days to reach the top of the well. Answer is ###{20}."

        "answer": "Let's assume the number of white bread loaves is 5x. Since the ratio of whole wheat to white bread is 3:5, the number of whole wheat loaves is 3x. We are given that they sell 40 more whole wheat loaves than white bread, so 3x = 5x + 40. Subtracting 5x from both sides gives us -2x = 40, and dividing both sides by -2 gives us x = -20. However, x cannot be negative because it represents the number of loaves. Let's re-examine the problem. Since the ratio of whole wheat to white bread is 3:5, we can let the number of white bread loaves be 5y and the number of whole wheat loaves be 3y. We are given that they sell 40 more whole wheat loaves than white bread, so 3y = 5y + 40. Subtracting 5y from both sides gives us -2y = 40, and dividing both sides by -2 gives us y = -20. Again, y cannot be negative. However, we are given that the total number of loaves is 480, so 3y + 5y = 480. Combining like terms gives us 8y = 480, and dividing both sides by 8 gives us y = 60.

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 2.3: x = 480 / 2.3 = 208.7. Since we can't sell a fraction of a cake, we round down to 208 cakes. The number of muffins sold is 1.3 x 208 = 270. The total amount of money made from muffins is 270 x $2 = $540. The total amount of money made from cakes is 208 x $3 = $624. The total amount of money made is $540 + $624 = $1164.

        "answer": "Let's denote the number of white bread loaves as x. Since they sell 60 more whole wheat loaves than white bread loaves, the number of whole wheat loaves is x + 60. The total number of loaves is the sum of white and whole wheat loaves, which is x + (x + 60). We are given that this sum is equal to 480, so we have the equation x + (x + 60) = 480.

        "answer": "To find the total number of books the bookshelf can hold, we multiply the number of shelves by the number of books each shelf can hold: 5 x 8 = 40. Since 240 books are already placed, we need to find how many more can be placed. We subtract 240 from the total capacity: 40 - 240 = -200. Since we can't have a negative number of books, we assume that the bookshelf is already full and no more books can be placed. However, we can also interpret this as the question asking how many more books can be placed after the bookshelf is already full, in which case the answer would be 0. Answer is ###{0}."

        "answer": "Let's assume the number of small boxes sold is x and the number of large boxes sold is y. We know that x + y = 480 and 12x + 24y = 480. We can simplify the second equation by dividing both sides by 4, giving us 3x + 6y = 120. To solve for x and y, we can use the substitution method. We can multiply the first equation by 3 to get 3x + 3y = 1440. Now we can subtract the second equation from this to get 3y = 1320, so y = 440. Substituting this into the first equation, we get x + 440 = 480, so x = 40. Therefore, the bakery sold 40 small boxes and 440 large boxes. Answer is ###{40, 440}."

We can solve the first equation for x: x = 480 - y. Substituting this into the second equation gives 2(480 - y) + 1.5y = 720. Expanding and simplifying gives 960 - 2y + 1.5y = 720, which simplifies to -0.5y = -240. Solving for y gives y = 480. Therefore, the bakery sold 480 boxes of oatmeal cookies. ###{480}."

On the first day, the snail climbs 3 feet and slips back 2 feet, so it climbs 1 foot. On the second day, it climbs 3 feet and slips back 2 feet, so it climbs 1 foot. This pattern continues until the snail climbs the remaining distance. The remaining distance is 15 - (15 - 3) = 3 feet.

        "question": "A bakery sells a total of 480 loaves of bread in a day. They sell whole wheat bread, white bread, and rye bread. The ratio of whole wheat to white bread is 2:3 and the ratio of white bread to rye bread is 3:2. How many loaves of rye bread were sold?",
        "answer": "Let's first find the total parts in the ratio of white bread, which is 3 + 2 = 5 parts. Now, we can find the number of loaves of white bread by dividing the total loaves by the total parts and multiplying it by the parts of white bread, which is 480 / 5 * 3 = 288. Since the ratio of white bread to rye bread is 3:2, the number of parts of rye bread is 2. So, the number of loaves of rye bread is 288 / 3 * 2 = 192. Therefore, the bakery sold ###{192} loaves of rye bread."

        "answer": "To find the number of boxes of oatmeal raisin cookies, we need to first find the total parts in the ratio, which is 5 + 3 = 8. Then we can find the value of one part by dividing the total number of boxes by the total parts. 480 / 8 = 60. Since the oatmeal raisin cookies make up 3 parts, we multiply 60 by 3 to find the total number of boxes of oatmeal raisin cookies. 60 x 3 = 180. So, they sold 180 boxes of oatmeal raisin cookies. ###{180}."

        "answer": "Let's use algebra to solve this problem. Let's say the number of white bread loaves is x. Then the number of whole wheat bread loaves is x + 60. Since they sell a total of 480 loaves, we can write the equation: x + (x + 60) = 480. Combine like terms: 2x + 60 = 480. Subtract 60 from both sides: 2x = 420. Divide both sides by 2: x = 210.

        "answer": "First, we need to find the discount on each type of bread. For the regular loaf, we calculate 15% of $2.50, which is 0.15 x 2.50 = $0.375. So, the sale price of the regular loaf is $2.50 - $0.375 = $2.125. For the whole wheat loaf, we calculate 20% of $3.25, which is 0.20 x 3.25 = $0.65. So, the sale price of the whole wheat loaf is $3.25 - $0.65 = $2.60. The total cost is then 2 x $2.125 + 1 x $2.60 = $4.25 + $2.60 = $6.85. Therefore, Sarah will pay $6.85 in total. ###{6.85}"

        "question": "A bakery sells a total of 480 boxes of cookies in a day. They sell a combination of small and large boxes. The ratio of small boxes to large boxes is 3:5. How many large boxes of cookies are sold in a day?",
        "answer": "Since the ratio of small boxes to large boxes is 3:5, we can say that for every 3 small boxes, there are 5 large boxes. Let's add the parts of the ratio: 3 + 5 = 8. So, the total number of parts is 8. We know that the total number of boxes is 480, so we can divide 480 by 8 to find out how many boxes each part represents: 480 / 8 = 60. Since the large boxes are represented by 5 parts, we multiply 5 by 60 to find the total number of large boxes: 5 x 60 = 300. Therefore, the bakery sells 300 large boxes of cookies in a day. ###{300}."

The number of boxes of oatmeal raisin cookies is 5 more than the number of boxes of chocolate chip cookies. How many boxes of chocolate chip cookies were sold?",
        "answer": "Let's say the number of boxes of chocolate chip cookies is x. Since the number of boxes of oatmeal raisin cookies is 5 more than the number of boxes of chocolate chip cookies, the number of boxes of oatmeal raisin cookies is x + 5. We know that the total number of boxes of cookies is 480, so x + (x + 5) = 480. Combining like terms, we get 2x + 5 = 480. Subtracting 5 from both sides, we get 2x = 475.

        "answer": "To find the total money made from selling white bread, we first need to find the number of white bread loaves sold. Let's say x is the number of white bread loaves sold. Since they sell a total of 480 loaves, the number of whole wheat bread loaves sold is 480 - x. The total money made is the sum of the money made from selling white bread and whole wheat bread. So, we can set up the equation: 1.5x + 2(480 - x) = 840. Now, let's solve the equation: 1.5x + 960 - 2x = 840. Combine like terms: -0.5x + 960 = 840. Subtract 960 from both sides: -0.5x = -120.

        "answer": "Let's say they sold x chocolate muffins. Since they sold 3 times as many blueberry muffins, they sold 3x blueberry muffins. The total number of muffins sold is 3x + x = 4x. We know that 4x = 480, so x = 480/4 = 120. They sold 120 chocolate muffins and 3x = 360 blueberry muffins. The profit from chocolate muffins is 120 x $0.75 = $90.

        "answer": "To find the total amount of money Maya has, we need to calculate how much she earned from working and add the gift from her grandmother. She earns $15 per hour, so she earns 15 x 5 = $<<15*5=75>>75 on Saturday. She also earns 15 x 3 = $<<15*3=45>>45 on Sunday. So, she earned a total of 75 + 45 = $<<75+45=120>>120 from working. Adding the gift from her grandmother, she now has 120 + 25 = $<<120+25=145>>145. Answer is ###{145}."

        "answer": "To find the total amount of sugar needed, we need to find out how many batches of 12 cookies they need to make. Since they need to make 48 cookies, we can divide 48 by 12 to get 4. This means they need to make 4 batches of cookies. Since each batch requires 2/3 cup of sugar, we multiply 4 by 2/3 to get 8/3. To convert this to a decimal, we divide 8 by 3, which is approximately 2.67. So, the bakery will need approximately 2.67 cups of sugar. Answer is ###{2.67}."

A small box contains 18 cookies and a large box contains 24 cookies. If the number of small boxes sold is 60 more than the number of large boxes sold, how many small and large boxes were sold in total?",
        "answer": "Let's denote the number of large boxes sold as x. Then the number of small boxes sold is x + 60. We know that the total number of boxes sold is 480. So, we can write the equation: x + (x + 60) = 480. Combining like terms, we get 2x + 60 = 480. Subtracting 60 from both sides gives us 2x = 420. Dividing both sides by 2 gives us x = 210. This means 210 large boxes were sold. Since the number of small boxes sold is 60 more than the number of large boxes sold, the number of small boxes sold is 210 + 60 = 270. The total number of boxes sold is 210 + 270 = 480. Answer is ###{480}."

The museum has 30 parking spots reserved for buses. How many more buses will the school need to rent so that all the students and chaperones can go on the trip?",
        "answer": "To find the total number of buses needed, we need to divide the total number of students and chaperones by the capacity of the bus. The total number of students and chaperones is 30 + 5 = 35. The bus can hold 60 students and 5 chaperones, so the total capacity is 65. To find the number of buses needed, we divide 35 by 65, but since we can't have a fraction of a bus, we need to round up. However, in this case, we can fit all the students and chaperones in one bus. So, the school will need 1 bus. But, to answer the question, if the bus can only hold 60 students and 5 chaperones, and the total number of students and chaperones is 35, then 35 / 65 = 0.5385, which is less than 1. So, the school will need 0 buses. However, the question is asking for the number of buses the school will need to rent so that all the students and chaperones can go on the trip, so the school will need 1 bus to ensure there is enough space.

        "answer": "Let's denote the number of white bread loaves as x. Since they sell 30 more whole wheat loaves than white bread loaves, the number of whole wheat loaves is x + 30. We know that 1/4 of the total loaves are whole wheat, so (x + 30) = 1/4 * 250. Solving for x, we get x = 250 - 30 = 220. So, the number of white bread loaves is 220 and the number of whole wheat loaves is 220 + 30 = 250. However, this is incorrect as 1/4 of 250 is 62.5, so (x + 30) = 62.5. Solving for x, we get x = 62.5 - 30 = 32.5. Since you can't sell a fraction of a loaf, we'll round down to 32 white bread loaves and 62.5 - 32.5 = 30 whole wheat loaves. Answer is ###{32, 62}."

The snail climbs 3 feet per day and slips back 2 feet per day, so the net distance it covers per day is 3 - 2 = 1 foot. Since the well is 25 feet deep, it will take the snail 25 / 1 = 25 days to reach the top of the well, but on the 25th day, it will only climb 3 feet and reach the top.

To find the number of days it takes to climb 20 feet, we need to divide the total distance by the net distance: 20 / 1 = 20.

To find the sale price of the whole wheat loaf, we need to calculate 20% of the original price and subtract it from the original price. 20% of $3.25 is 0.20 x 3.25 = $0.65. So, the sale price of the whole wheat loaf is 3.25 - 0.65 = $2.60. The total cost will be 2.125 + 2.60 = $4.725. Answer is ###{4.725}."

        "answer": "Let's say the number of small boxes sold is x and the number of large boxes sold is y. We know that x + y = 480. We also know that 12x + 24y = total number of cookies. Since each small box has 12 cookies and each large box has 24 cookies. We can simplify the second equation to 3x + 6y = total number of cookies. Since 12x = 3 * 4x, and 24y = 6 * 4y. Now we can divide both sides of the equation by 4 to get 3x + 6y = 120. Now we can divide both sides by 3 to get x + 2y = 40. Now we can substitute x = 40 - 2y into the first equation to get 40 - 2y + y = 480. Simplifying, we get 40 - y = 480. Now we can add y to both sides to get 40 = 480 + y. Now we can subtract 480 from both sides to get -440 = y. However, this is not possible because y cannot be negative. So, we need to go back to the equation x + 2y = 40 and try to find a different solution. We can try to find a number that when multiplied by 2 gives us a number that when added to another number gives us 40. Let's try y = 18. Then 2 * 18 = 36. 36 + 4 = 40. So, y = 18 is a possible solution. Now we can substitute y = 18 into the first equation to get x + 18 = 480. Now we can subtract 18 from both sides to get x = 462. Now that we have x and y, we can find the number of boxes of each type that were sold. The number of small boxes sold is x = 462. The number of large boxes sold is y = 18. The answer is ###{462 small boxes and 18 large boxes}."

        "answer": "Let's say the number of whole wheat bread is 5x and the number of white bread is 3x. Since they sell the same number of whole wheat and white bread on Monday, we can set 5x = 3x. However, this is not possible, so this is not the case. We know the total number of loaves of bread is 480. So, 5x + 3x = 480. 8x = 480. x = 60. So, the number of whole wheat bread is 5x = 5 * 60 = <<5*60=300>>300. The answer is ###{300}."

        "question": "A snail is at the bottom of a 20-foot well. Each day, it climbs up 3 feet, but at night, it slips back 2 feet. How many days will it take for the snail to reach the top of the well?",
        "answer": "To find the number of days it will take for the snail to reach the top of the well, we need to find the number of days it takes to cover the remaining distance after the initial climb. On the first day, the snail climbs 3 feet and slips back 2 feet, so it effectively climbs 1 foot. On the second day, it climbs 3 feet and slips back 2 feet, effectively climbing 1 foot again. This pattern continues until it reaches the top of the well. So, the snail effectively climbs 1 foot per day. To climb 20 feet, it will take the snail 20 / 1 = 20 days. However, this is not correct because the snail climbs 3 feet on the last day and reaches the top. Therefore, it will take the snail 19 days to climb 19 feet and then 1 day to climb the remaining 1 foot. The total number of days is 19 + 1 = 20. Answer is ###{20}."

So, we can set up the equation x + (x + 120) = 480. Combining like terms, we get 2x + 120 = 480. Subtracting 120 from both sides, we get 2x = 360. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 180. So, the number of cakes sold is 180. Since the number of muffins sold is x + 120, the number of muffins sold is 180 + 120 = 300. The answer is ###{300}."

        "question": "A bakery sells 480 loaves of bread in a day. They sell a combination of whole wheat and white bread. If the ratio of whole wheat to white bread is 3:5, how many loaves of white bread were sold?",
        "answer": "To find the number of white bread loaves sold, we need to find the total number of parts in the ratio and then find what fraction of the total bread sold is white bread. The ratio of whole wheat to white bread is 3:5, so the total number of parts is 3 + 5 = 8. The fraction of white bread is 5/8. To find the number of white bread loaves sold, we multiply the fraction by the total number of loaves sold: (5/8) * 480 = 300. Answer is ###{300}."

        "answer": "Let's say the number of white bread loaves sold is x. Then, the number of whole wheat loaves sold is 3x. We know that x + 3x = 480 (total loaves sold) and x >= 80 (minimum white bread loaves sold). To find the minimum value of x, we can set x = 80. Then, 80 + 3x = 80 + 3(80) = 80 + 240 = 320. Since 320 < 480, we need to increase x. We can try x = 160. Then, 160 + 3x = 160 + 3(160) = 160 + 480 = 640. Since 640 > 480, we know that x = 160 is the correct answer. So, the number of whole wheat loaves sold is 3x = 3(160) = 480. Answer is ###{480}."

        "answer": "Let's assume the number of white bread loaves is x. Then, the number of whole wheat bread loaves is x + 40% of x. We are given that the total number of loaves is 480 and the number of white bread loaves is 240. So, we can set up the equation: x + (x + 40% of x) = 480. Simplifying this equation, we get 2x + 0.4x = 480, which becomes 2.4x = 480. Solving for x, we get x = 200.

Large boxes contain 36 cookies each and small boxes contain 18 cookies each. If the number of large boxes sold is 1/4 of the total number of boxes, how many boxes of each type were sold?",
        "answer": "Let's start by determining the number of large boxes sold. Since the number of large boxes is 1/4 of the total, we can calculate this by dividing the total number of boxes by 4. 480 / 4 = 120. This means 120 large boxes were sold. To find the number of small boxes, we subtract the number of large boxes from the total. 480 - 120 = 360. This means 360 small boxes were sold. To find the number of cookies from large boxes, we multiply the number of large boxes by the number of cookies in each box. 120 x 36 = 4320. To find the number of cookies from small boxes, we multiply the number of small boxes by the number of cookies in each box. 360 x 18 = 6480. The total number of cookies is the sum of the cookies from large and small boxes. 4320 + 6480 = 10800. Answer is ###{10800}."

        "answer": "First, we need to calculate the discount for each type of bread. The discount on a regular loaf is 15% of $2.50, which is 0.15 x $2.50 = $0.375. So the sale price of a regular loaf is $2.50 - $0.375 = $2.125. The discount on a whole wheat loaf is 20% of $3.25, which is 0.20 x $3.25 = $0.65. So the sale price of a whole wheat loaf is $3.25 - $0.65 = $2.60. Now we can find the total cost by adding the cost of the 2 regular loaves and 1 whole wheat loaf: 2 x $2.125 = $4.25 and $2.60.

        "answer": "Let's denote the number of regular cupcakes as x. Since they sell 120 more chocolate cupcakes, the number of chocolate cupcakes is x + 120. The total number of cupcakes is the sum of regular and chocolate cupcakes, which is x + (x + 120) = 2x + 120. We know that the total number of cupcakes is 480, so 2x + 120 = 480. Solving for x, we get 2x = 360 and x = 180. So, the number of regular cupcakes is 180 and the number of chocolate cupcakes is 180 + 120 = 300. Since each type of cupcake has 12 layers, the total number of layers is 180 x 12 = 2160 + 300 x 12 = 3600. Therefore, the bakery sells a total of 2160 + 3600 = 5760 layers of cupcakes. ###{5760}"

Then, the number of white bread loaves sold is 480 - x.\nThe revenue from the sale of whole wheat bread is 2.50x dollars. The revenue from the sale of white bread is 1.75(480 - x) dollars.\nThe total revenue is 2.50x + 1.75(480 - x).\nSince they make a 25% profit on the sale of whole wheat bread, the cost of each whole wheat loaf is 2.50 / 1.25 = 2 dollars. Similarly, the cost of each white bread loaf is 1.75 / 0.85 = 2.0588 dollars (approximately).\nLet's calculate the cost of all the bread sold: 2x + 2.0588(480 - x).\nNow, we can calculate the profit: (2.50x + 1.75(480 - x)) - (2x + 2.0588(480 - x)).\nSimplifying this expression, we get 0.442x + 840 - 987.984 = 0.442x - 147.984.\nSince x is the number of whole wheat bread loaves sold, it must be a non-negative integer. To maximize the profit, we want to sell as many whole wheat bread loaves as possible, so we set x = 480, the total number of loaves sold. Then, the profit is 0.442(480) - 147.984 = 211.616.\nSo, the bakery makes approximately $211.62 in a day. ###{211.62}."

        "answer": "First, let's find the discount on each type of bread. The discount on a regular loaf is 15% of $2.50, which is 0.15 x $2.50 = $0.375. The discount on a whole wheat loaf is 15% of $3.25, which is 0.15 x $3.25 = $0.4875. So, the price of a regular loaf after the discount is $2.50 - $0.375 = $2.125. The price of a whole wheat loaf after the discount is $3.25 - $0.4875 = $3.0625. Now, let's find the total cost of the bread. 2 regular loaves cost 2 x $2.125 = $4.25. 1 whole wheat loaf costs $3.0625. So, the total cost is $4.25 + $3.0625 = $7.3125. Answer is ###{7.3125}"

Since each shelf can hold 8 books, we divide the total number of books by the number of shelves to find out how many shelves are filled: 36 / 8 = 4.5. However, we can't have half a shelf, so we know that all 4 shelves are filled and there are 4 x 8 = 32 books on the shelves. The remaining books (36 - 32 = 4) must be on the 5th shelf.

        "answer": "Let's assume the number of sugar-free cookies is 3x. Then the number of regular cookies is 5x. Since they sell 40 more boxes of regular cookies, we can write the equation 5x = 3x + 40. Subtracting 3x from both sides, we get 2x = 40. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 20.

        "question": "A bakery sells a total of 480 loaves of bread in a day. They sell a combination of whole wheat and white bread. If the ratio of whole wheat to white bread is 3:5 and they sell whole wheat bread for $2 per loaf and white bread for $1.50 per loaf, how much money do they make in total?",
        "answer": "First, let's find out how many loaves of whole wheat and white bread they sell. The ratio of whole wheat to white bread is 3:5, so the total number of parts is 3 + 5 = 8. To find out how many loaves each part represents, we divide the total number of loaves by the total number of parts: 480 / 8 = 60. So, they sell 3 x 60 = 180 loaves of whole wheat bread and 5 x 60 = 300 loaves of white bread. The total amount of money they make from whole wheat bread is 180 x $2 = $360. The total amount of money they make from white bread is 300 x $1.50 = $450. The total amount of money they make is $360 + $450 = $810. Answer is ###{810}."

        "answer": "Since the bakery sells 80 white bread loaves, and they sell 60 more whole wheat loaves than white bread, the number of whole wheat loaves is 80 + 60 = 140. The total number of loaves of bread sold per day is 140 + 80 = 220. To find the number of whole wheat loaves, we need to find the difference between the total number of loaves and the number of white bread loaves. So, the number of whole wheat loaves is 480 - 80 = 400. However, this is incorrect. We are looking for the number of whole wheat loaves, not the difference between the total and white bread. So, we need to find the number of whole wheat loaves by adding 60 to the number of white bread loaves. The number of whole wheat loaves is 80 + 60 = 140. The answer is ###{140}."

        "answer": "To find the total amount of sugar needed, we need to first find out how many recipes are required. Since each recipe makes 24 cookies and the bakery wants to make 480 cookies, we divide 480 by 24 to get the number of recipes: 480 / 24 = 20. Now, since each recipe requires 2/3 cup of sugar, we multiply the number of recipes by the amount of sugar per recipe: 20 * 2/3 = 40/3. To convert this to a decimal, we divide 40 by 3: 40/3 = 13.33. So, the bakery will need approximately 13.33 cups of sugar. Answer is ###{13.33}."

Since the bakery sells 480 boxes and each box contains 24 cookies, the total number of cookies sold is 480 x 24 = 11520. If each cookie is sold at $2, the total amount of money made is 11520 x $2 = $<<480*24*2=23040>>23040. The bakery makes $###{23040} in a day."

        "answer": "Let's say the number of white bread loaves is x. Since they sell 30 more whole wheat loaves, the number of whole wheat loaves is x + 30. The total number of loaves is 480, so we can set up the equation: x + (x + 30) = 480. Combining like terms, we get 2x + 30 = 480. Subtracting 30 from both sides gives 2x = 450.

        "question": "A bakery sells a total of 480 loaves of bread per day. They sell a combination of whole wheat and white bread. If they sell 60 more loaves of whole wheat bread than white bread, and they sell at least 100 loaves of white bread, how many loaves of each type of bread do they sell?",
        "answer": "Let's denote the number of white bread loaves as W and whole wheat bread loaves as WW. We know that WW = W + 60 and that W + WW = 480. Substituting WW with W + 60, we get W + W + 60 = 480. Combining like terms, we get 2W + 60 = 480. Subtracting 60 from both sides, we get 2W = 420. Dividing both sides by 2, we get W = 210. So, they sell 210 loaves of white bread and 210 + 60 = 270 loaves of whole wheat bread. Answer is ###{210, 270}."

        "answer": "Let's first find the rate of work of each pump. The first pump can fill the tank in 4 hours, so its rate of work is 1/4 of the tank per hour. When two pumps are used, the rate of work is 1/2 of the tank per hour. The combined rate of work of two pumps is 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2 of the tank per hour. So, the rate of work of the second pump is also 1/4 of the tank per hour. Now, if three pumps are used, their combined rate of work is 1/4 + 1/4 + 1/4 = 3/4 of the tank per hour. So, the time taken to fill the tank with three pumps is 1 / (3/4) = 4/3 hours. To convert this to hours, we can divide 4 by 3, which is approximately 1.33 hours.

The price of 2 regular loaves after discount is 2 x ($2.50 - $0.375) = 2 x $2.125 = $4.25. Now, let's calculate the discount for the whole wheat loaf. 20% of $3.25 is 0.20 x $3.25 = $0.65. So the discount is $0.65. The price of 1 whole wheat loaf after discount is $3.25 - $0.65 = $2.60. The total price before tax is $4.25 + $2.60 = $6.85.

        "answer": "First, let's calculate the discount for the whole wheat bread. 15% of $2.50 is 0.15 x 2.50 = $0.375. So, the sale price of the whole wheat bread is 2.50 - 0.375 = $2.125 per loaf. The total cost of 2 loaves of whole wheat bread is 2 x 2.125 = $4.25. Next, let's calculate the discount for the white bread. 20% of $2.00 is 0.20 x 2.00 = $0.40. So, the sale price of the white bread is 2.00 - 0.40 = $1.60 per loaf. The total cost of 3 loaves of white bread is 3 x 1.60 = $4.80.

How much will you pay for 2 loaves of whole wheat bread and 1 loaf of white bread after the discount?",
        "answer": "First, let's find the discount on the whole wheat bread. The discount is 15% of $2.50, which is 0.15 x $2.50 = $0.375. So, the price of one loaf of whole wheat bread after the discount is $2.50 - $0.375 = $2.125. The price of two loaves of whole wheat bread is 2 x $2.125 = $4.25. Next, let's find the discount on the white bread. The discount is 12% of $2.25, which is 0.12 x $2.25 = $0.27. So, the price of one loaf of white bread after the discount is $2.25 - $0.27 = $1.98.

The perimeter of the garden is the total length of the fencing, which is 48 meters. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is 2(length + width). So, we can write the equation: 2(W + (W + 4)) = 48. Simplifying the equation, we get 2(2W + 4) = 48, 4W + 8 = 48, 4W = 40, W = 10. The width is 10 meters. Since the length is 4 meters more than the width, the length is 10 + 4 = 14 meters. The width and length together use 10 + 14 = <<10+14=24>>24 meters of fencing.

        "answer": "To find the total amount of money, we need to multiply the number of loaves by the price of each loaf and add the results together. The bakery sells 250 loaves at $2 each, so they make 250 x 2 = $<<250*2=500>>500 from these loaves. They also sell 150 loaves at $1.50 each, so they make 150 x 1.5 = $<<150*1.5=225>>225 from these loaves. The total amount of money is 500 + 225 = $<<500+225=725>>725.

        "question": "A bookshelf has 5 shelves, and each shelf can hold 8 books. If the bookshelf is currently empty and 120 books are placed on it, how many shelves will be completely filled?",
        "answer": "To find the number of shelves that will be completely filled, we need to divide the total number of books by the number of books each shelf can hold. 120 books / 8 books per shelf = 15. Since we can't have a fraction of a shelf, we'll round down to 15. However, we need to check if there are enough books to fill 15 shelves. Since 15 shelves * 8 books/shelf = 120 books, which is equal to the total number of books, we know that exactly 15 shelves will be completely filled. Answer is ###{15}."

        "answer": "Let's denote the number of white bread as x. Since they sold 60 more whole wheat bread than white bread, the number of whole wheat bread is x + 60. The total number of loaves of bread sold is x + (x + 60) = 480. Combining like terms, we get 2x + 60 = 480. Subtracting 60 from both sides, we get 2x = 420. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 210.

A loaf of white bread normally costs $2.00, but it's on sale for 20% off. How much will you save on a whole wheat loaf and a white loaf if you buy them both at the sale price?",
        "answer": "First, let's find the discount on the whole wheat bread. 15% of $2.50 is 0.15 x 2.50 = $0.375. So, the discount on the whole wheat bread is $0.375. The sale price of the whole wheat bread is 2.50 - 0.375 = $2.125. Next, let's find the discount on the white bread. 20% of $2.00 is 0.20 x 2.00 = $0.40. So, the discount on the white bread is $0.40. The sale price of the white bread is 2.00 - 0.40 = $1.60. To find the total amount saved, add the discounts on both breads: $0.375 + $0.40 = $0.775. So, you will save ###{0.775}."

A loaf of white bread normally costs $2.00, but it's on sale for 20% off. If a customer buys 2 loaves of whole wheat bread and 3 loaves of white bread, how much will they pay in total?",
        "answer": "First, find the discount on each type of bread. The discount on whole wheat bread is 15% of $2.50, which is 0.15 x 2.50 = $<<0.15*2.50=0.375>>0.375. So the sale price of whole wheat bread is 2.50 - 0.375 = $2.125. The discount on white bread is 20% of $2.00, which is 0.20 x 2.00 = $0.40. So the sale price of white bread is 2.00 - 0.40 = $1.60. Now, multiply the number of each type of bread by its sale price. 2 loaves of whole wheat bread cost 2 x 2.125 = $4.25. 3 loaves of white bread cost 3 x 1.60 = $4.80. To find the total cost, add the cost of the whole wheat bread and the white bread: 4.25 + 4.80 = $9.05. The customer will pay $9.05 in total. ###{9.05}"

        "question": "A bakery is making a special offer on bread. A loaf of bread normally costs $2.50. If the bakery is offering a 15% discount, how much will a customer pay for 5 loaves of bread?",
        "answer": "First, we need to find the discount amount. To do this, we need to calculate 15% of the normal price of 5 loaves of bread. The normal price of 5 loaves is 5 x $2.50 = $12.50. 15% of $12.50 is 0.15 x $12.50 = $1.875. Now, we subtract the discount from the normal price to get the sale price. $12.50 - $1.875 = $10.625. Therefore, the customer will pay $10.625 for 5 loaves of bread. Answer is ###{10.625}."

        "answer": "To find the net rate at which the tank is being filled, we need to subtract the rate at which water is leaking out from the rate at which it is being filled. So, the net rate is 100 - 20 = 80 liters per minute. To find the time it will take to fill the tank, we need to divide the total capacity of the tank by the net rate.

So, 600 liters are in the tank. The remaining space is 2400 - 600 = 1800 liters. 1/6 of the remaining space is 1800 * (1/6) = 300 liters.

To find the total number of books the bookshelf can hold, we multiply the number of shelves by the number of books each shelf can hold: 5 x 8 = 40. The bookshelf can hold 40 books. Since 120 books are already added, the number of remaining space is 40 - 120 = -80. Since we cannot have a negative number of books, we will rephrase the question to: If the bookshelf is currently empty and 120 books are added, and we want to know how many more books can be added, then the answer is: The bookshelf can hold 40 books, and 120 books are already added. So, the remaining space is 40 - 120 = -80. The bookshelf is full and cannot hold any more books. Answer is ###{0}."

Since 3/4 of 2400 is equal to (3/4) x 2400 = 1800, this means that 1800 liters of water are already in the tank. To find the amount of water left, we subtract 1800 from the total capacity of the tank: 2400 - 1800 = 600. Therefore, there are 600 liters of water left in the tank. ###{600}."

        "question": "A group of friends are planning a road trip and want to fill their car's gas tank, which can hold 60 liters of gas. They have two types of gas cans: large cans that hold 15 liters and small cans that hold 5 liters. If they have already filled 3 large cans and 5 small cans, how many more large cans can they fill with the remaining gas?",
        "answer": "First, let's calculate the amount of gas already used: 3 large cans * 15 liters per can = 45 liters and 5 small cans * 5 liters per can = 25 liters. So, the total gas used is 45 + 25 = 70 liters. Since the car's gas tank can hold 60 liters, the remaining gas is 60 - 70 = -10 liters, which is not possible, so we need to recalculate the amount of gas used. Let's assume the remaining gas is 60 - 70 + 60 = 50 liters. 3 large cans * 15 liters per can = 45 liters. 50 - 45 = 5 liters. Since 5 liters is less than 15 liters, we can fill 1 more large can.

        "answer": "Let's call the width x. Since the length is 5 meters more than the width, the length is x + 5. The area of a rectangle is length times width, so we can set up the equation x(x + 5) = 240. Expanding the equation, we get x^2 + 5x - 240 = 0. Factoring the quadratic equation, we get (x + 16)(x - 15) = 0. This gives us two possible values for x: x = -16 and x = 15. Since the width cannot be negative, the width of the garden is 15 meters.

        "answer": "Let's analyze the situation: each day, the snail climbs 3 feet and slips back 2 feet, so it effectively moves 1 foot up the well each day. To find the number of days it takes for the snail to reach the top, we subtract the distance it slips back from the total height of the well: 20 - 2 = 18 feet. Since the snail effectively moves 1 foot per day, it will take 18 days for the snail to reach the top of the well. Answer is ###{18}."

        "answer": "To find the total number of days, we need to calculate the number of days it takes for the snail to climb the remaining distance after slipping back at night. On the first day, the snail climbs 3 feet and slips back 2 feet, so it covers 1 foot. On the second day, it climbs 3 feet and slips back 2 feet, so it covers 1 foot again. This pattern continues until the snail reaches the top of the well. The snail climbs 3 feet in a day, and slips back 2 feet, so it effectively covers 1 foot in a day. To cover 18 feet, it will take the snail 18 days. On the 19th day, the snail will climb the remaining 2 feet and reach the top of the well. Therefore, the snail will take a total of 19 days to reach the top of the well. ###{19}"

Expanding and simplifying, we get 4x + 240 = x + 480. Subtracting x from both sides gives us 3x + 240 = 480. Subtracting 240 from both sides gives us 3x = 240. Dividing both sides by 3 gives us x = 80. So they sell 80 loaves of white bread and 80 + 60 = 140 loaves of whole wheat bread. The answer is ###{80, 140}."

The snail climbs 3 feet up and slips 2 feet back, so it effectively covers 3 - 2 = 1 foot per day. To reach the top of the 20-foot well, it will take 20 / 1 = 20 days. However, the snail doesn't need to climb the last 2 feet, as it will reach the top on the 20th day after climbing 18 feet.

        "answer": "Let's start by finding the number of whole wheat loaves. Since they sell 1/4 of their total loaves as whole wheat, we can calculate this by multiplying the total loaves by 1/4. 1/4 of 480 is 480 x 0.25 = 120. Since they sell 60 more loaves of whole wheat than white bread, we can represent the number of white loaves as x. So, the number of whole wheat loaves is x + 60. We know that the total number of whole wheat loaves is 120, so we can set up the equation x + 60 = 120. Solving for x, we get x = 60. Therefore, they sell 60 loaves of white bread. ###{60}"

        "answer": "First, we need to find the total price before the discount. 3 loaves of bread cost 3 x $2.50 = $<<3*2.5=7.50>>7.50. The discount is 10% of $7.50, which is 0.1 x $7.50 = $<<0.1*7.5=0.75>>0.75. So, John will pay $7.50 - $0.75 = $<<7.5-0.75=6.75>>6.75 in total. ###{6.75}"

        "answer": "To find the total number of boxes the bookshelf can hold, we need to multiply the number of shelves by the number of boxes each shelf can hold. 5 shelves x 8 boxes/shelf = 40 boxes. Since the bookshelf can hold 40 boxes and there are 120 boxes to be placed, we need to subtract the capacity of the bookshelf from the total number of boxes. 120 - 40 = 80. Therefore, there will be 80 boxes left over. Answer is ###{80}."

        "answer": "To find the total amount of money made, we need to multiply the number of loaves sold per day by the number of days they operate. They sell 480 loaves per day, so in 20 days they sell 480 x 20 = 9600 loaves. Since each loaf costs $2, the total amount of money made is 9600 x $2 = $<<480*20=9600>>9600.

        "answer": "Let's say they sold x number of whole wheat bread and x number of rye bread. Since they sold the same number of each, we can set up the equation: x + x = 480. This means they sold 2x = 480 loaves of bread. To find x, we divide both sides by 2, so x = 240. Since they sold 240 whole wheat bread and 240 rye bread, and each whole wheat bread costs $2 and each rye bread costs $1.50, the total amount of money they made is 240 x 2 + 240 x 1.5 = 480 + 360 = 840.

        "answer": "To find the profit, we need to subtract the fixed cost from the total revenue. The total revenue is the number of loaves sold multiplied by the profit per loaf, which is 250 x $0.50 = $<<250*0.50=125>>125. So, the profit is $125 - $150 = -$25.

        "answer": "Let's say the number of white bread loaves is x. Since they sell 3 times as many whole wheat loaves, the number of whole wheat loaves is 3x. The total number of loaves is the sum of white and whole wheat loaves, which is x + 3x = 4x. We know the total number of loaves is 480, so 4x = 480. To find x, we divide both sides by 4: x = 480 / 4 = 120. So, they sell 120 loaves of white bread per day. Answer is ###{120}."

        "answer": "Let's say the number of white bread loaves sold is x. Then, the number of whole wheat bread loaves sold is x + 10% of x = 1.1x. The total number of loaves sold is 250, so x + 1.1x = 250. Combining like terms, 2.1x = 250. Dividing both sides by 2.1, x = 250 / 2.1 = 119.05. Since we can't sell a fraction of a loaf, we round down to 119. So, the bakery sells 119 loaves of white bread per day. There are 119 + 10% of 119 = 119 + 11.9 = 130.9 loaves of whole wheat bread sold per day. So, there are 130.9 - 119 = 11.9 more whole wheat bread loaves sold per day. ###{11}"

        "answer": "First, we need to find the total rate at which all the pipes are filling the tank. 3 pipes are filling at 40 liters per minute, so that's 3 x 40 = 120 liters per minute. 2 pipes are filling at 30 liters per minute, so that's 2 x 30 = 60 liters per minute. 1 pipe is filling at 50 liters per minute. Adding all these rates together, we get 120 + 60 + 50 = 230 liters per minute. To find the time it takes to fill the tank, we divide the total capacity of the tank (1200 liters) by the rate at which the pipes are filling it (230 liters per minute).

        "answer": "Let's say the number of small boxes sold is x and the number of large boxes sold is y. We know that x + y = 480. We also know that 12x + 24y = total number of cookies. Since there are 12 cookies in a small box and 24 cookies in a large box, the total number of cookies is 12x + 24y. We can simplify this to 12(x + 2y) = 12x + 24y. Since x + y = 480, we can substitute this into the equation to get 12(480) = 12x + 24y. This simplifies to 5760 = 12x + 24y. Now, we can divide both sides by 12 to get 480 = x + 2y. Since x + y = 480, we can substitute this into the equation to get 480 = 480 + 2y - y. This simplifies to 480 = 480 + y. Solving for y, we get y = 0. Since y cannot be 0, we know that the number of large boxes sold must be 0. So, the number of small boxes sold is 480. The answer is ###{480}."

        "answer": "Let's represent the number of whole wheat loaves as x + 60, since they sell 60 more than white bread. The total number of loaves is 480, so we can set up the equation x + (x + 60) = 480. Combining like terms, we get 2x + 60 = 480. Subtracting 60 from both sides gives 2x = 420. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 210. So, they sell 210 white bread loaves. Since they sell 60 more whole wheat loaves, they sell 210 + 60 = 270 whole wheat loaves. ###{270}"

Since it climbs 1 foot every day, it will take the snail 20 - 1 = 19 days to reach the top of the well. However, it will climb 1 foot on the 20th day as well, so it will take the snail 20 days to reach the top of the well. Answer is ###{20}."

        "answer": "Since they sell 1/5 of their total bread as whole wheat, they sell 1 - 1/5 = 4/5 as white bread. Let's denote the number of white bread loaves as x. Since they sell 60 more whole wheat loaves, the total number of whole wheat loaves is x + 60. We know that the total number of loaves is 480, so x + (x + 60) = 480. Combining like terms, we get 2x + 60 = 480. Subtracting 60 from both sides, we get 2x = 420. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 210. Therefore, they sell 210 loaves of white bread. ###{210}"

If they sell 60 more loaves of whole wheat bread than white bread and they sell 1/3 of the total bread as whole wheat, how many loaves of whole wheat bread do they sell per day?",
        "answer": "Let's denote the number of white bread loaves as x. Since they sell 60 more loaves of whole wheat bread, the number of whole wheat loaves is x + 60. We are given that 1/3 of the total bread is whole wheat, so we can set up the equation: (x + 60) = (1/3) * 480. To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 3: 3(x + 60) = 480. This simplifies to 3x + 180 = 480. Subtracting 180 from both sides gives us 3x = 300. Dividing both sides by 3, we get x = 100.

        "answer": "To find the total number of minutes, we need to calculate the total rate at which the pipes are filling the tank. 3 pipes are filling the tank at 50 liters per minute, so that's 3 x 50 = 150 liters per minute. 2 pipes are filling the tank at 30 liters per minute, so that's 2 x 30 = 60 liters per minute. The last pipe is filling the tank at 20 liters per minute. The total rate is 150 + 60 + 20 = 230 liters per minute. If the tank can hold 2400 liters, we can find the time it takes to fill the tank by dividing the total capacity by the rate at which it's being filled: 2400 / 230 = 10.43 minutes. Answer is ###{10.43}."

        "question": "A bakery sells a total of 480 loaves of bread per day. They sell a combination of whole wheat and white bread. If they sell 60 more whole wheat breads than white breads and they sell 3/4 of the total breads as white bread, how many whole wheat breads and white breads do they sell?",
        "answer": "Let's denote the number of white breads as W and the number of whole wheat breads as WW. We know that WW = W + 60 and W + WW = 480. We can substitute WW in the second equation with W + 60, so we get W + (W + 60) = 480. This simplifies to 2W + 60 = 480. Subtracting 60 from both sides gives us 2W = 420. Dividing both sides by 2 gives us W = 210. Since WW = W + 60, WW = 210 + 60 = 270. Therefore, the bakery sells 210 white breads and 270 whole wheat breads. Answer is ###{210, 270}."

        "answer": "First, we need to find out how many liters of water are still needed to fill the tank. 2400 - 1200 = 1200 liters. Since 3 pipes are filling the tank at 80 liters per minute each, they fill 3 x 80 = 240 liters per minute. To find the time it takes to fill the tank, we divide the remaining liters by the rate at which they are being filled: 1200 / 240 = 5 minutes. So, it will take 5 minutes to fill the tank completely. ###{5}"

        "answer": "Let's denote the number of white bread loaves as W and the number of whole wheat bread loaves as WW. We know that W + WW = 480 and WW = 1.3W (since they sell 30% more whole wheat than white bread). We can substitute WW in the first equation: W + 1.3W = 480. Combining like terms, we get 2.3W = 480. Dividing both sides by 2.3, we get W = 208.8. However, we can't sell a fraction of a loaf, so we round down to 208 loaves of white bread. Now, we can find WW: WW = 1.3W = 1.3 * 208 = 270.8. Rounding down again, we get WW = 270 loaves of whole wheat bread. Answer is ###{270}."

        "answer": "To find the remaining amount of sugar needed, we need to subtract the amount already added from the total amount required. 3/4 - 1/8 can be calculated by finding a common denominator, which is 8. So, 3/4 is equal to 6/8. The remaining amount is 6/8 - 1/8 = 5/8. Since the baker has a 1/4 cup measuring cup, we need to convert 5/8 to cups. 5/8 is equal to 0.625, which is equivalent to 5/8. Since the baker has a 1/4 cup measuring cup, she needs to add 5/8 - 1/4 = 3/8. 3/8 is equal to 0.375 cups. So, she needs to add 0.375 cups or 3/8 of a cup of sugar. Answer is ###{0.375}."

        "answer": "To find the total profit, we need to calculate the profit from whole wheat bread and white bread separately. Let's assume they sell x number of whole wheat breads and y number of white breads. We know that x + y = 480. The profit from whole wheat bread is $0.50x and the profit from white bread is $0.25y. The total profit is $0.50x + $0.25y. We can express y as 480 - x and substitute it into the profit equation: $0.50x + $0.25(480 - x) = $0.50x + $120 - $0.25x = $0.25x + $120. Since we don't have a specific value for x, we can't find the exact profit. However, we can express it as $0.25x + $120.

If they sold 60 more whole wheat loaves than white loaves, and each whole wheat loaf costs $2.25, while each white loaf costs $2.00, what is the total amount of money they made from selling the bread?",
        "answer": "Let's denote the number of white loaves as x. Then the number of whole wheat loaves is x + 60. We know that x + (x + 60) = 480, so 2x + 60 = 480. Subtracting 60 from both sides gives 2x = 420, and dividing both sides by 2 gives x = 210. So, the number of white loaves is 210 and the number of whole wheat loaves is 210 + 60 = 270. The total amount of money made from selling the white loaves is 210 x $2.00 = $420. The total amount of money made from selling the whole wheat loaves is 270 x $2.25 = $607.50. The total amount of money made is $420 + $607.50 = $1027.50. The answer is ###{1027.50}."

        "answer": "Let's denote the number of chocolate chip cookies as x. Since the number of chocolate chip cookies is 1/4 of the total number of cookies, we can write the equation x + (x + 40) = 480. Combining like terms, we get 2x + 40 = 480. Subtracting 40 from both sides, we get 2x = 440. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 220. Therefore, the number of chocolate chip cookies sold is 220. Answer is ###{220}."

        "answer": "Let's denote the number of white bread loaves as x. Then, the number of whole wheat bread loaves is x + 60. The total number of loaves is x + (x + 60) = 480. Combining like terms, we get 2x + 60 = 480. Subtracting 60 from both sides, we get 2x = 420. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 210. So, the bakery sold 210 loaves of white bread. The number of whole wheat bread loaves is 210 + 60 = 270. The answer is ###{270}."

        "answer": "Let's say the number of large boxes sold is x. Then the number of small boxes sold is 3x. We know that the total number of boxes sold is 480, so we can write the equation x + 3x = 480. Combining like terms, we get 4x = 480. Dividing both sides by 4, we get x = 120. So, the number of large boxes sold is 120 and the number of small boxes sold is 3x = 3 x 120 = 360. Therefore, the bakery sold 120 large boxes and 360 small boxes. Answer is ###{120, 360}."

        "answer": "Let's represent the number of large boxes as 5x and the number of small boxes as 3x, where x is a constant. We know that the total number of boxes is 480, so we can set up the equation 5x + 3x = 480. Combining like terms, we get 8x = 480. To solve for x, we divide both sides by 8, giving us x = 60.

If the total amount of money made from selling the cookies is $900, how many boxes of oatmeal raisin cookies were sold?",
        "answer": "Let's assume the number of chocolate chip cookies sold is x and the number of oatmeal raisin cookies sold is y. We know that x + y = 480 (total number of boxes sold). We also know that 2x + 1.5y = 900 (total amount of money made). We can solve this system of equations by substituting x = 480 - y into the second equation. This gives us 2(480 - y) + 1.5y = 900. Simplifying this equation, we get 960 - 2y + 1.5y = 900. Combining like terms, we get -0.5y = -60. Solving for y, we get y = 120. So, the bakery sold 120 boxes of oatmeal raisin cookies.

        "answer": "First, we need to find the discount for each type of bread. The discount for the regular loaf is 2.50 x 0.15 = $<<2.50*0.15=0.375>>0.375. The discount for the whole wheat loaf is 3.25 x 0.20 = $<<3.25*0.20=0.65>>0.65. Now, we subtract the discounts from the original prices. The regular loaves will cost 2.50 - 0.375 = $<<2.50-0.375=2.125>>2.125 each. The whole wheat loaf will cost 3.25 - 0.65 = $<<3.25-0.65=2.60>>2.60. Now, we multiply the price of each type of bread by the number of loaves Sarah buys. The total cost of the regular loaves is 2 x 2.125 = $<<2*2.125=4.25>>4.25. The total cost of the whole wheat loaf is 1 x 2.60 = $<<1*2.60=2.60>>2.60. Finally, we add the total cost of all the loaves to find the total amount Sarah will pay.

A loaf of white bread normally costs $1.75, but it's on sale for 20% off. How much will you pay for one loaf of whole wheat bread and one loaf of white bread during the sale?",
        "answer": "First, we need to calculate the discount for each type of bread. The discount for whole wheat bread is 15% of $2.50, which is $2.50 x 0.15 = $0.375. So the sale price for whole wheat bread is $2.50 - $0.375 = $2.125. The discount for white bread is 20% of $1.75, which is $1.75 x 0.20 = $0.35. So the sale price for white bread is $1.75 - $0.35 = $1.40. Therefore, the total cost for one loaf of whole wheat bread and one loaf of white bread is $2.125 + $1.40 = $3.525. Answer is ###{3.525}."

        "answer": "Let's denote the number of white bread loaves as x. Then, the number of whole wheat bread loaves is x + 60. Since they sell a total of 480 loaves, we can write the equation x + (x + 60) = 480. Combining like terms, we get 2x + 60 = 480. Subtracting 60 from both sides, we get 2x = 420.

        "question": "A water tank can hold 480 gallons of water. If 3/4 of the tank is already filled with water and 12 more gallons are added each hour, how many hours will it take to fill the tank?",
        "answer": "First, we need to find out how many gallons of water are already in the tank. 3/4 of 480 is 360. To find out how many gallons are left to fill, we subtract 360 from 480: 480 - 360 = 120. Now we need to find out how many hours it will take to fill the remaining 120 gallons. 12 gallons are added each hour, so we divide 120 by 12: 120 / 12 = 10. It will take 10 hours to fill the tank.

        "answer": "The snail climbs 3 feet up and slips 2 feet back each day, so it effectively climbs 1 foot up each day. To find the number of days it takes to reach the top, we need to subtract the number of feet it has already climbed from the total height of the well. The snail has already climbed 3 feet, so it needs to climb 15 - 3 = 12 feet. Since it climbs 1 foot per day, it will take the snail 12 days to reach the top. Answer is ###{12}."

        "answer": "To find the amount of water in the tank after 3/4 is filled, we need to multiply the total capacity by 3/4. 3/4 of 1200 is (3/4) x 1200 = 900 gallons. 120 more gallons are added to the tank, so there are 900 + 120 = 1020 gallons of water in the tank. 1/4 of the remaining water is then removed, so we need to multiply 1020 by 1/4. 1/4 of 1020 is (1/4) x 1020 = 255 gallons. The amount of water left in the tank is 1020 - 255 = 765 gallons. ###{765}"

        "answer": "To find the number of white bread loaves, we need to calculate 2/5 of the total number of loaves. Since 3/5 of the bread is whole wheat, the remaining 2/5 is white bread. To find 2/5 of 480, we multiply 480 by 2 and divide by 5. 480 * 2 = 960, 960 / 5 = 192. So, the bakery sells 192 loaves of white bread. Answer is ###{192}."

The large boxes contain 24 cookies each, and the small boxes contain 12 cookies each. If they made a total of $960 from selling the large boxes, how many boxes of each type were sold?",
        "answer": "Let's denote the number of large boxes as L and the number of small boxes as S. We know that L + S = 480 (total number of boxes) and 24L + 12S = 960 (total amount of money made from large boxes). We can simplify the second equation by dividing both sides by 12, resulting in 2L + S = 80. Now we can solve the system of equations by subtracting the second equation from the first, which gives us L = 400. Substituting this value into the first equation, we get 400 + S = 480, which means S = 80. So, 400 large boxes and 80 small boxes were sold. Answer is ###{400, 80}."

        "answer": "Let's say the number of small boxes sold is x. Since they sell 2/3 as many large boxes as small boxes, the number of large boxes sold is (2/3)x. The total number of boxes sold is the sum of the large and small boxes, which is x + (2/3)x. We know this is equal to 480, so we can write the equation x + (2/3)x = 480. Combining like terms, we get (5/3)x = 480. Multiplying both sides by 3/5, we get x = 288. So, the number of small boxes sold is ###{288}."

A loaf of white bread normally costs $2.00, but it's on sale for 20% off. If Maria buys 2 loaves of whole wheat bread and 3 loaves of white bread, how much will she pay in total?",
        "answer": "First, let's calculate the discount on each type of bread. The discount on whole wheat bread is 15% of $2.50, which is 0.15 x 2.50 = $0.375. So, the sale price of whole wheat bread is $2.50 - $0.375 = $2.125 per loaf. The discount on white bread is 20% of $2.00, which is 0.20 x 2.00 = $0.40. So, the sale price of white bread is $2.00 - $0.40 = $1.60 per loaf. Now, let's calculate the total cost. Maria buys 2 loaves of whole wheat bread at $2.125 per loaf, so the total cost of whole wheat bread is 2 x $2.125 = $4.25. She also buys 3 loaves of white bread at $1.60 per loaf, so the total cost of white bread is 3 x $1.60 = $4.80. Therefore, the total amount Maria will pay is $4.25 + $4.80 = $9.05.

        "question": "May is planning a road trip and fills her gas tank, which holds 15 gallons. She drives 270 miles on the highway and then 120 miles on city streets. If her car gets 30 miles per gallon on the highway and 20 miles per gallon in the city, how many gallons of gas does she use in total?",
        "answer": "To find the total number of gallons used, we need to calculate the gallons used on the highway and the gallons used in the city. She drives 270 miles on the highway and her car gets 30 miles per gallon, so the gallons used on the highway is 270 / 30 = 9 gallons. She drives 120 miles in the city and her car gets 20 miles per gallon, so the gallons used in the city is 120 / 20 = 6 gallons. The total gallons used is 9 + 6 = 15 gallons. However, since her tank holds 15 gallons, she must have started with a full tank. Therefore, she uses a total of 15 - 15 = ###{0} gallons."

        "answer": "To find the amount saved, we need to calculate the discount for each type of bread. The regular loaf has a discount of 15% off $2.50, which is 0.15 x 2.50 = $0.375. The whole wheat loaf has a discount of 20% off $3.25, which is 0.20 x 3.25 = $0.65. The whole wheat loaf has a greater discount, so you will save $0.65 - $0.375 = $0.275 by buying a whole wheat loaf instead of a regular loaf. Answer is ###{0.275}."

We know c = 10 and one of the other sides (let's say a) = 6. We need to find the other side (b). So, the equation becomes 6^2 + b^2 = 10^2. This simplifies to 36 + b^2 = 100. Subtracting 36 from both sides gives us b^2 = 64. Taking the square root of both sides gives us b = 8. Therefore, the length of the third side is 8cm. Answer is ###{8}."

        "answer": "Let's assume the number of small boxes sold is x. Then the number of large boxes sold is x + (1/3)x = (4/3)x. We know that the total number of boxes sold is 480, so we can set up the equation: x + (4/3)x = 480. To solve for x, we need to combine like terms: (7/3)x = 480. Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction: 7x = 1440. Now, divide both sides by 7 to solve for x: x = 1440 / 7 = 205.71. Since the number of boxes cannot be a decimal, we round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, the number of boxes should be a whole number. So we have to check our equation. If we check our equation we will see that (4/3)x = 160. So the total number of small boxes is 480 - 160 = 320. Answer is ###{320}."

        "answer": "Let's say the number of whole wheat bread sold is 3x and the number of white bread sold is 5x. Since the total number of loaves sold is 480, we can set up the equation 3x + 5x = 480. Combining like terms, we get 8x = 480. Dividing both sides by 8, we get x = 60.

        "answer": "The total ratio parts for white bread is 5 + 2 = 7. We know that the total parts for white bread is 5. So, the total parts for whole wheat bread is 3 * 5 / 5 = 3.

        "answer": "To find the sale price of the regular loaf, we need to calculate 15% of $2.50 and subtract it from the original price. 15% of $2.50 is 0.15 x $2.50 = $0.375. So, the sale price of the regular loaf is $2.50 - $0.375 = $2.125. To find the sale price of the whole wheat loaf, we need to calculate 20% of $3.25 and subtract it from the original price. 20% of $3.25 is 0.20 x $3.25 = $0.65. So, the sale price of the whole wheat loaf is $3.25 - $0.65 = $2.60. Therefore, the total cost will be $2.125 + $2.60 = $4.725. Answer is ###{4.725}."

So, the number of white bread loaves is 210 and the number of whole wheat loaves is 210 + 60 = 270. Each white bread loaf costs $1.50 and each whole wheat loaf costs $1.50 + $2 = $3. The total revenue from white bread is 210 x $1.50 = $315 and the total revenue from whole wheat bread is 270 x $3 = $810. The total revenue is $315 + $810 = $1125. The answer is ###{1125}."

        "answer": "Let's say the number of white bread loaves sold is W and the number of whole wheat bread loaves sold is W + 30% of W. We know that W + (W + 30% of W) = 480. Since 30% of W is 0.3W, we can rewrite the equation as W + W + 0.3W = 480. Combining like terms, we get 2.3W = 480. To solve for W, we divide both sides by 2.3: W = 480 / 2.3 = 208.7. Since we can't sell a fraction of a loaf, we round down to 208. Now that we know the number of white bread loaves sold is 208, we can find the number of whole wheat bread loaves sold by adding 30% of 208 to 208. 30% of 208 is 0.3 x 208 = 62.4.

We know that b:c = 5:3, so we can write this as b = (5/8)(b+c). We also know that b + c = 480. Substituting this into the first equation, we get b = (5/8)(480). So, b = 300. Therefore, the bakery sold 300 blueberry muffins. Answer is ###{300}."

        "answer": "Let's say the number of white loaves is x. Then the number of whole wheat loaves is 2x. We know that the total number of loaves is 480, so x + 2x = 480. Combining like terms, we get 3x = 480. Dividing both sides by 3, we get x = 160. So the number of white loaves is 160 and the number of whole wheat loaves is 2x = 320. The total amount of money made from white loaves is 160 x $1.75 = $280. The total amount of money made from whole wheat loaves is 320 x $2.50 = $800.

        "answer": "The bakery sells x loaves of white bread and x + 15 loaves of whole wheat bread. To find the total number of loaves, we need to add the number of white bread and whole wheat bread. Total loaves = x + (x + 15) = 2x + 15. Since the bakery sells 250 loaves per day, we can set up the equation 2x + 15 = 250. Solving for x, we get 2x = 235, x = 117.5. So, the bakery sells 117.5 + 15 = 132.5 loaves of whole wheat bread. However, since we can't sell a fraction of a loaf, we'll round down to 117 whole wheat loaves.

        "answer": "First, we need to find the discount for the regular loaf of bread. The discount is 15% of $2.50, which is 0.15 x $2.50 = $0.375.

        "answer": "To find the total number of books that can be held on the bookshelf, we need to multiply the number of shelves by the number of books each shelf can hold. So, 5 shelves x 8 books/shelf = 40 books. Since 120 books are added and the bookshelf can hold 40 books, the remaining books that will be left on the bookshelf after all the shelves are filled are 120 - 40 = 80. However, since the question asks for the number of books that will be on the bookshelf after all the shelves are filled, we need to find the number of books on the bookshelf when it is full.

        "answer": "Let's denote the number of white breads as W and the number of whole wheat breads as WW. We know that W + WW = 480 and WW = W + 60. We can substitute the second equation into the first one: W + (W + 60) = 480. This simplifies to 2W + 60 = 480. Subtracting 60 from both sides gives 2W = 420. Dividing both sides by 2 gives W = 210. Since WW = W + 60, WW = 210 + 60 = 270. Therefore, the bakery sold 270 whole wheat breads. The difference between the number of whole wheat and white breads is WW - W = 270 - 210 = 60.

        "answer": "To find the number of small boxes sold, we need to multiply the total number of boxes by 2/5. 2/5 of 480 is 192. This means 192 boxes are small boxes. Since each small box contains 12 cookies, the total number of cookies in the small boxes is 192 x 12 = 2304. To find the number of cookies in the large boxes, we subtract the number of cookies in the small boxes from the total number of cookies. The total number of cookies is 480 x 12 = 5760. 5760 - 2304 = 3456. Since each large box contains 24 cookies, the number of large boxes sold is 3456 / 24 = 144. Answer is ###{144}."

If the bakery sold the cupcakes and cakes for the same price and made a total of $864, and the cupcakes were sold for 1/4 of the total sales, how much money did the bakery make from selling the cakes?",
        "answer": "Let's denote the price of a cupcake as x and the price of a cake as y. Since the cupcakes were sold for 1/4 of the total sales, the cupcakes generated 1/4 * 864 = 216 dollars. Since the cupcakes are sold in packs of 12, the number of packs sold is 216 / 12 = 18. This means 18 cakes were sold. Since the cakes are sold in packs of 8, the number of packs sold is 480 / 8 = 60. So the total number of cakes is 60. The total money made from cakes is 60 * y. Since the total sales is 864, we can set up the equation 18 * x + 60 * y = 864. Since the cupcakes were sold for 1/4 of the total sales, we can also set up the equation 18 * x = 216. Solving for x, we get x = 12. Substituting x into the first equation, we get 18 * 12 + 60 * y = 864. Simplifying, we get 216 + 60 * y = 864. Subtracting 216 from both sides, we get 60 * y = 648.

        "answer": "To find out how much water is still needed, we need to find out how much water the tank can hold and subtract the amount that is already filled. The tank can hold 2400 liters. 3/5 of the tank is already filled, so we need to find 3/5 of 2400. 3/5 of 2400 is (3/5) x 2400 = 1440. So, the tank is already filled with 1440 liters. To find out how much water is still needed, we subtract 1440 from 2400. 2400 - 1440 = 960. So, the water tank still needs 960 liters of water to be filled. ###{960}."

A loaf of white bread normally costs $1.75, but it's on sale for 20% off. If Sarah buys 2 loaves of whole wheat bread and 3 loaves of white bread, how much will she pay in total?",
        "answer": "To find the total cost, we need to calculate the discount for each type of bread and then add them up. The whole wheat bread is on sale for 15% off, so the discount is 2.50 x 0.15 = 0.375. The sale price of whole wheat bread is 2.50 - 0.375 = 2.125. Since Sarah buys 2 loaves of whole wheat bread, the total cost for whole wheat bread is 2 x 2.125 = 4.25. The white bread is on sale for 20% off, so the discount is 1.75 x 0.20 = 0.35. The sale price of white bread is 1.75 - 0.35 = 1.40. Since Sarah buys 3 loaves of white bread, the total cost for white bread is 3 x 1.40 = 4.20. The total cost is 4.25 + 4.20 = 8.45. ###{8.45}."

        "answer": "First, let's find the total revenue from bread sales. They sell 250 loaves per day at $0.50 profit per loaf, so their revenue from bread is 250 x $0.50 = $<<250*0.50=125>>125. Next, let's find the revenue from pastry sales. They sell 120 pastries at $1.25 each, so their revenue from pastries is 120 x $1.25 = $150. The total revenue is $125 + $150 = $<<125+150=275>>275. Since their rent is $150, their daily profit is $275 - $150 = $<<275-150=125>>125. Answer is ###{125}."

        "answer": "Let's say the number of large boxes sold is x. Since they sell 3 times as many small boxes, the number of small boxes sold is 3x. We know that the total number of boxes sold is 480. So, we can set up the equation x + 3x = 480. Combining like terms, we get 4x = 480. Dividing both sides by 4, we get x = 120.

        "answer": "Let's say the number of white bread loaves is W. We know that W + (W + 60) = 480, because the total number of loaves is 480. Combining like terms, we get 2W + 60 = 480. Subtracting 60 from both sides, we get 2W = 420. Dividing both sides by 2, we get W = 210. Since W is the number of white bread loaves, the number of whole wheat loaves is W + 60 = 210 + 60 = 270.

If they sell an equal number of boxes each day from Wednesday to Sunday, how many boxes does the bakery sell on each of these days?",
        "answer": "To find the number of boxes sold on Monday and Tuesday, we need to calculate 3/4 of the total boxes. 3/4 of 480 is (3/4) x 480 = 360 boxes. This means they sold 360 boxes on Monday and Tuesday combined. Since they sold an equal number of boxes each day from Wednesday to Sunday, we need to subtract the number of boxes sold on Monday and Tuesday from the total and divide by 6. So, the number of boxes sold on Monday and Tuesday is 360. The number of boxes sold from Wednesday to Sunday is 480 - 360 = 120. This is 120 / 6 = 20 boxes per day.

        "answer": "Let's represent the number of large boxes as L. Since the number of small boxes is 40 more than the number of large boxes, the number of small boxes is L + 40. We know that the total number of boxes is 480, so we can represent this as L + (L + 40) = 480. Simplifying the equation, we get 2L + 40 = 480. Subtracting 40 from both sides, we get 2L = 440.

We can substitute WW in the first equation with W + 60: W + (W + 60) = 240. Combining like terms, we get 2W + 60 = 240. Subtracting 60 from both sides gives 2W = 180. Dividing both sides by 2 gives W = 90. Since WW = W + 60, WW = 90 + 60 = 150. So, the bakery sells 150 whole wheat loaves. Answer is ###{150}."

        "answer": "Let's use a variable to represent the number of chocolate chip cookies sold. Let x be the number of chocolate chip cookies sold. Then, the number of oatmeal raisin cookies sold is 480 - x. The total amount of money made from chocolate chip cookies is $1x and from oatmeal raisin cookies is $1.25(480 - x). The total amount of money made is $525, so we can set up the equation: $1x + $1.25(480 - x) = $525. To solve for x, we can distribute $1.25 to 480 - x and then combine like terms: $1x + $600 - $1.25x = $525. Then, we can combine like terms to get -$0.25x + $600 = $525. Next, we can subtract $600 from both sides to get -$0.25x = -$75. Finally, we can divide both sides by -0.25 to find x: x = $300. So, the bakery sold 300 chocolate chip cookies. ###{300}"

        "answer": "Let's denote the number of whole wheat bread as x and the number of white bread as y. We know that x + y = 480 (total loaves sold) and 2x + 1.5y = 840 (total money made). We can solve this system of equations by multiplying the second equation by 100 to get rid of the decimal, which gives us 200x + 150y = 84000. Then, we can multiply the first equation by 1.5 to get 1.5x + 1.5y = 720. Subtracting this equation from the second equation, we get 198.5x = 81600. Solving for x, we get x = 411.
