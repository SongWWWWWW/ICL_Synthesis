        "answer": "Let's say the number of loaves of white bread sold is x. Then, the number of loaves of whole wheat bread sold is x + 30.\nSince the total number of loaves sold is 250, we can set up the equation: x + (x + 30) = 250\nCombine like terms: 2x + 30 = 250\nSubtract 30 from both sides: 2x = 220\nDivide both sides by 2: x = 110\nSo, the number of loaves of white bread sold is 110.\nThe number of loaves of whole wheat bread sold is 110 + 30 = 140.\nThe total amount made from whole wheat bread is 140 x 2.50 = 350.\n#### ###{350}"

        "answer": "Let x be the number of loaves of white bread sold. Since they sell 30% more whole wheat bread than white bread, they sell x + 1.3x = 120 loaves of whole wheat bread.

Since the total number of cookies is 480, we can set up the equation 8x = 480. Solving for x, we get x = 60. The number of chocolate chip cookies is 3x = 3*60 = 180. ###{180}"

        "answer": "Let's denote the number of days as d. At the end of the dth day, the snail will have climbed 3d feet. Since it slips back 2 feet each night, it will have actually climbed 3d - 2d = d feet. The well is 20 feet deep, so we set up the equation d = 20. Solving for d, we get d = 20. Since the snail climbs 3 feet each day, it will take 20/3 = 6.67 days to reach the top of the well, but since you can't climb a fraction of a day, it will take the snail 7 days to reach the top. ###{7}"

        "answer": "Let M be the number of muffins and C be the number of cakes. We know that M + C = 480. We also know that 3/4 of the muffins were sold, so 3M/4 were sold. We also know that 5/6 of the cakes were sold, so 5C/6 were sold. The total number of baked goods sold is the sum of the muffins and cakes sold, which is (3M/4) + (5C/6). We can set up an equation to represent this: (3M/4) + (5C/6) = (3M + 5C)/4. We know that M + C = 480, so we can substitute this into the equation to get (3M + 5C)/4 = (3(480 - C)/4 + 5C/6). Simplifying this equation, we get (3M + 5C)/4 = 360 - C/4 + 5C/6. Now we can solve for C: 3M + 5C = 1440 - C + 5C. Simplifying this equation, we get 3M = 1440 - 6C. Since M + C = 480, we can substitute this into the equation to get 3(480 - C) = 1440 - 6C. Simplifying this equation, we get 1440 - 3C = 1440 - 6C. Subtracting 1440 from both sides, we get -3C = -6C. Adding 6C to both sides, we get 3C = 0. Dividing both sides by 3, we get C = 0. Since C = 0, we know that M = 480. The total number of baked goods sold is (3M/4) + (5C/6) = (3(480)/4) + (5(0)/6) = 360. The fraction of the total baked goods that were sold is 360/480 = 3/4. ###{3/4}"

The total number of loaves sold is the sum of whole wheat and white bread, which is x + (5/3)*x = 240. Simplifying the equation, we get 8x/3 = 240. Multiplying both sides by 3, we get 8x = 720.

Since they sell 30% more whole wheat bread than white bread, the number of loaves of whole wheat bread sold is x + 0.3x = 1.3x.

The total amount of money they made is 2.50x + 3.00(x + 60). We know that the total number of loaves is 240, so we can set up the equation 2.50x + 3.00(x + 60) = 240.00. Simplifying the equation, we get 5.50x + 180 = 240.00. Subtracting 180 from both sides gives us 5.50x = 60.00. Dividing both sides by 5.50 gives us x = 10.91. So they sold 10.91 loaves of whole wheat bread. Since they sold 60 more loaves of rye bread, they sold 10.91 + 60 = 70.91 loaves of rye bread. The total amount of money they made is 2.50 * 10.91 + 3.00 * 70.91 = 25.775 + 210.27 = 236.05. ###{236.05}"

        "question": "A bakery sells a total of 480 loaves of bread per day. They sell a combination of whole wheat and white bread. If the ratio of whole wheat to white bread is 3:5, how many loaves of white bread do they sell per day?",
        "answer": "Let's first find the total number of whole wheat loaves. Since the ratio is 3:5, the number of whole wheat loaves is 3x and the number of white loaves is 5x, where x is a common factor. The total number of loaves is 480, so 3x + 5x = 480. Simplifying, 8x = 480, and x = 60. The number of white loaves is 5x = 5*60 = 300. ###{300}"

        "question": "A bakery sells a total of 250 loaves of bread per day. They sell whole wheat bread for $2 per loaf and white bread for $1.50 per loaf. If they sell 30 more loaves of whole wheat bread than white bread, how much money do they make in a day?",
        "answer": "Let x be the number of loaves of white bread. Then, the number of loaves of whole wheat bread is x + 30. The total number of loaves is 250, so x + (x + 30) = 250. Simplifying, we get 2x + 30 = 250. Subtracting 30 from both sides, we get 2x = 220. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 110. So, the number of loaves of whole wheat bread is 110 + 30 = 140. The total amount of money made is 2(110) + 1.5(140) = 220 + 210 = 430. ###{430}"

        "answer": "The regular loaf costs $2.50, and the whole wheat loaf costs $3.25. The difference is $3.25 - $2.50 = $0.75. So, you will save $0.75 if you buy the whole wheat loaf instead of the regular loaf. ###{0.75}"

        "answer": "Let x be the number of loaves of whole wheat bread sold. The ratio of whole wheat to white bread is 3:5, so the number of loaves of white bread sold is 5x/3. The total number of loaves sold is 240, so we can set up the equation x + (5x/3) = 240. Simplifying the equation, we get 8x/3 = 240. Multiplying both sides by 3, we get 8x = 720.

The total number of loaves is the sum of white and whole wheat loaves, so we can set up the equation: x + 1.3x = 250. Combine like terms: 2.3x = 250. Divide both sides by 2.3: x = 250/2.3 = 108.5.
